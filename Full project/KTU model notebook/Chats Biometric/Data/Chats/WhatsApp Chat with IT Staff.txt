branch, focusing on specialised services that customers require in convenient locations,” it said – NewsDay, Tuesday

*Follow Pindula on WhatsApp for daily new updates*
https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va84dngJP21B2nWeyM3v?ws


According to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT), an average family of six now needs a minimum of ZWL$5.4 million to cover their monthly expenses. This represents a 65.8% increase compared to the figures recorded last month.

ZIMSTAT also revealed that the Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL) for one person was ZW$ 916,225.50 in March 2024. Said ZIMSTAT:

> This means that an individual required that much to purchase both non-food and food items as of March 2024 in order not to be deemed poor.

> This represents an increase of 65.8 per cent when compared to the February 2024 figure of ZWL$552,745.80.


The Food Poverty Line (FPL) for one person in March 2024 was ZWL$701,236.89. This means that the minimum needs basket cost that much per person in March 2024. This represents an increase of 62.2 per cent over the February 2024 figure of ZWL$432,454.90.

The Zimbabwe dollar has plummeted over the past few weeks which economic commentators have blamed on the excessive printing of money by the central bank that is not backed by value.

On Friday, March 22, the Zimbabwean dollar crossed a notable threshold, falling below 20,000 against the US dollar. This decline occurred after it had previously dropped below the 10,000 level in late January.

The local currency was trading at 20,389 per greenback, indicating a cumulative decline of 70% since the beginning of the year.

Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube, recently Zimbabwe will always have a local currency even though currently, the US dollar is used for 80% of all commerce in the country.

Ncube said the monetary policy statement (MPS), which is overdue by two months, will be released soon, adding that there are ongoing consultations with experts within the government and other stakeholders.

*Follow Pindula on WhatsApp for daily news updates*

THE Government is finalising new regulations to set up a State-controlled third-party motor vehicle insurance scheme that will assume the responsibility of underwriting compulsory vehicle liability insurance, currently handled by private insurers.

The regulations, set to be unveiled next month, will see private insurers relinquishing their role in underwriting third-party motor vehicle insurance, which is compulsory in terms of the Road Traffic Act.

Presently, it covers death, injury and damage to property in road traffic accidents.

The authorities believe the coverage offered by private insurers is insufficient and often leaves policyholders with additional expenses, especially when claims are made after accidents.

Conversely, the State-backed scheme is envisaged to offer a broader range of benefits, including covering medical expenses incurred following accidents; financial compensation for injuries sustained in accidents; funeral grants in the event of an accident-related death and compensation for lost income due to injuries.

Top lawyer Fadzayi Mahere has raised concerns over the Government’s plans to introduce a “structured currency.”

She argues that the lack of public education and the absence of a legal framework pose significant challenges to its implementation.

In February, President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced that the Government was actively working on a structured currency as part of their efforts to enhance currency and economic stability.

Reports indicate that the launch of this structured currency is imminent, coinciding with the appointment of John Mushayavanhu as the new Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor.

Fadzayi Mahere, sharing her thoughts on social media, advises the public to exercise caution. She points out that previous currency introductions in recent years have all faced challenges and ultimately failed. She said:


> Rule number one, if they mention anything to do with “1:1 gedye”, know we are heading for disaster. Last time they said that we ended up at 1:42000.

> Rule number two, if they mention anything to do with “gold backing”, know it’s a scam. What happened to the gold-backed Ziggy jiggy? Did it stabilise the economy?

> Rule number three, no legal framework, no legal tender. You don’t “launch” a currency like you’re launching a music album.

> It is called “legal tender” for a reason. It must have the force of law. You can’t roll out something as important as money without a legal statute.

> Rule number four, why the ambush? Why not give people notice of what you’re trying to do so you calm suspicion?

> They have a knack for taking an economic idea and mangling it so it implodes – look no further than the forex auction that wasn’t an auction.

> How many times do we need to learn the lesson that command economics does not work?

Bulawayo Mayor David Coltart also warned that the proposed “structured currency” will face challenges unless the institutions overseeing its introduction and management regain public trust. He said:

> I have noted statements made recently that the current government intends to introduce a new currency this week with some alarm.

> The solution to hyperinflation and a weakening currency does not lie in replacing it with a new currency.

> The reason our present currency has performed so badly is that people DO NOT TRUST the institution responsible for regulating it.

> The most important criterion in the running of any central bank is TRUST. Until TRUST is restored this new currency is doomed to fail as well.

> TRUST is only created when those running the central bank are recognized professionals who have been appointed because of their integrity and demonstrable skills, not who they know.

> TRUST is only created when there is total transparency and the central bank is demonstrably being run for the benefit of all, not just a small ruling clique.


In recent years, the Goverment has introduced several currencies that include Bearer Cheques, Traveller’s Cheques, Agro-Cheques, Bond Coins, Bond Notes, RTGS, Zim Dollars, Nostro, Gold Token and ZiG.

Hanzi pane varikuita basa rekuti when you’re trying to reverse from your parking, they move near your car then scream and say you’ve run over their foot. Usually vanenge vakamira ne ‘shamwari’ dzavo and they will all start loudly accusing you to attract a crowd, apawo uyu ‘wekutsikwa’ achizhamba making a scene, and you know people havatani kuungana and start taking videos etc. Then the ‘victim’ will say something like ndiendesei ku Avenues (knowing it’s expensive) ozoti horaiti chindipai USD100 or something similar. So please be careful. Even ma streetkids are doing this. And even some people will move their cars as you are reversing just so you can bump them a little then demand cash vs the hassle of involving the police. Dont be victims please. Stay safe.

----------
RBZ recent introduction of the new currency, ZiG, alongside the existing USD and ZWL (bond note & RTGS), has ushered in a period of calculation complications. With three official currencies now in circulation, navigating through exchange rates and conversions has become difficult. 
However, an online currency exchange calculator has been launched today, designed to simplify the conversion process for the primary currencies used in Zimbabwe.

This online tool, provided by TechNews Zimbabwe, offers users the convenience of effortless conversions between USD, ZiG, and ZWL, helping them adapt to the changing financial landscape with ease. Try out the calculator at https://zig.technews.co.zw

Although President Emmerson Mnangagwa has warned security personnel against taking part in criminal activities and vowed to use ruthless means to deal with them, reports indicate otherwise. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi on Friday appealed to members of the public to expose the uniformed forces involved in criminal activities. “Some robberies are linked to members of the security services in the country,” Nyathi told Southern Eye in an interview on Friday – Southern Eye, Monday April 8, Pg 6

10/04/2024, 07:57 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: ‘ZiG difficult to accept in US$-dominated market: Respected businessman and economist Nigel Chanakira says acceptance of the new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), will be difficult given that the majority still prefer the greenback. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) launched ZiG and scrapped the Zimdollar last week after the latter had significantly depreciated over the past few months. In the first quarter of the year alone, the Zimdollar depreciated by slightly more than 260%. Chanakira made the remarks at a post-2024 Monetary Policy and Outlook Conference yesterday which was hosted by NewsDay’s sister paper Zimbabwe Independent. Chanakira asked the conference attendees who were close to 200 to show by raising of hands, which currency they preferred between the US dollar and ZiG and all chose the former – NewsDay, Wednesday April 10, Pg 1

11/04/2024, 07:51 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Traders begin accepting ZiG currency: Some traders have started accepting ZiG currency after banks successfully configured their digital platforms and the shops reset their prices in the new currency. Other traders are now at an advanced stage to migrate to the use of the new local currency before tomorrow’s deadline. Mainstream large retailers were transacting in both ZiG and foreign currency by allowing those with bank cards to swipe after the banks completed configuring their systems so the cards would work. According to a market update by Zimswitch, which has already completed the roll out of the ZiG processing system, about 15 banks were live with the ZiG by yesterday. These included NMB Bank Limited, POSB, InnBucks, Empowerment Bank, Stanbic Bank, ZB Financial Holdings, Nedbank, CABS, First Capital Bank, Ecobank, One Money, O’mari, My Cash, African Century, EcoCash and Steward Bank, with the few remaining indicating that they would follow suit and beat tomorrow’s deadline. Zimswitch is the country’s sole national payments platform and clearing house. It was incorporated in 1994 to process domestic card-based, both ATM and point of sale “swipe”, and EFT transactions among member financial institutions in real-time online. EcoCash Holdings, the largest local mobile money platform, notified its customers yesterday that it had successfully converted Zimbabwean dollars to ZiG currency although there were delays in letting people spend their ZiG balances on EcoCash products.

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has urged traders, including commuter omnibuses, shops, fresh vegetable markets, and vendors, to continue accepting Zimbabwe dollar notes until April 30, 2024.

The majority of service providers and shops no longer accept Zim dollar notes, leading to a “change crisis.” As a result, prices are now being rounded off to US$1, making goods and services more expensive.

----------

In a statement issued this Wednesday by the Central Bank, Governor John Mushayavanhu reiterated that the Zim dollar remains legal tender. Reads the statement:


> ZIMBABWE DOLLAR NOTES CO-CIRCULATING WITH ZiG AND OTHER CURRENCIES

> Further to the Reserve Bank’s Press Statement of 6 April 2024 on currency conversion from ZW$ to ZiG, the banking sector and payment service providers have made significant and satisfactory progress, in this regard.

> Commendably, over 90% of the banking institutions and mobile bank service providers have successfully configured their systems and processes from ZW$ to ZiG, with banking services now being accessible for the convenience of the transacting public.

> The Reserve Bank is also encouraged by the positive response and enthusiasm from the business community and the public at large to embrace and use ZiG.

> The Reserve Bank has, however, taken note of the concerns of the public emanating from the rejection of the ZW$ notes to be demonetised, which has resulted in the unavailability of “change”, thus forcing businesses, mainly commuter omnibuses to round off prices to US$1.

> In this context, the Reserve Bank would like to reiterate that the ZW$ notes currently in circulation are still valid and remain legal tender until 30 April 2024.

> Accordingly, the ZW$ notes should continue to be used for transactional purposes at the announced ZiG/ZW$ conversion factor of 2498.7242.

> Business entities where the notes have been widely used, including commuter omnibuses, shops, fresh vegetable markets, and vendors, are advised to continue accepting payment in ZW$ notes until 30 April 2024.

> For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank advises the public and businesses that the Know Your Customer (KYC) transaction limit of ZW$100,000 does not apply to proceeds from legitimate business transactions during the transition period to 30 April 2024.

> The Reserve Bank wishes to advise the public that the educational and awareness campaign on the transition from the ZW$ to the use of ZiG in the market is currently underway and expected to be all-inclusive, reaching out to a wider spectrum of society by the 30th of April 2024, in line with the Bank’s financial inclusion strategy.

NSSA Mail
​
Dear Colleagues,


Please be advised that Harare Gardens has become criminally ridden of late as there are two puzzling murder cases recorded that occurred in broad daylight recently where armed robbers stabbed two victims on separate occasions using sharp objects to subdue victims into submission to hand over their valuables such as phones and handbags. This is indeed scary taking into account that we are juxtaposed with Harare Gardens, and we urge NSSA staff and surrounding neighbours to immediately desist from using Harare Gardens as a thoroughfare to either access passport offices or other related places close to Harare Gardens. Please take heed, life is precious and don’t be a statistic. 

 

Kind regards,

Starlink is shutting down its services in Zimbabwe. Technology publication, Techzim, has reported that people using Starlink received an email today telling them the Zimbabwean  government has demanded that the service be shut down.

Here’s a screenshot of the email they received from Starlink:

> You are currently using Starlink in an unauthorised territory, As a result. Starlink has been directed by the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) to disable your service.

✅ *Follow Pindula on WhatsApp for daily new updates*
https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va84dngJP21B2nWeyM3v?oe

> We will continue to work with POTRAZ to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to turn on Starlink services in Zimbabwe as soon as possible. We encourage you to contact POTRAZ at the.regulator@potraz.gov.zw or +263 242 333032 to communicate your support for Starlink to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in Zimbabwe.

> As described In your Terms of Service, Starlink does not guarantee when or where its Mobile or Mobile Priority Services Plans will be available. Use of such services Is dependent on many factors, including obtaining or maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals which are subject to change.

> You may pause service and billing by following the Instructions here or continue service and use your Starlink service in an area we currently serve (see map here), If you opt to pause service, you can reach out to support and we will issue a service credit for any remainder of the current billing period.

According to the Techzim report, Starlink has about an estimated 5,000 users of the service in the country.

In February, the telecoms regulator in Zimbabwe POTRAZ, said that while Starlink had expressed interest in getting a license to  operate in Zimbabwe, it had actually not applied for one. Users of the service were therefore essentially breaking the law.

Last month, reports suggested that government was holding meetings with officials from Starlink over licensing of the service in Zimbabwe.

Pindula spoke to one user familiar with the situation who commented on how such a shut down works:

> So what this means is that Starlink are not able to offer service to their customers in Zimbabwe.

> If someome who has a Starlink kit travels to Zimbabwe, Starlink are not in a position to offer service.

> If the user goes somewhere else, like any of the countries they’re registered in (Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Eswatini, Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya, etc) or any other country that they’re not banned in (Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Angola, etc) then the device will work

Zimbabwean users are not the first to receive such a notice from Starlink. Reports last month suggest users in DRC also had their Starlink terminals shut down in similar circumstances.

Starlink offers the cheapest means to communicate to the internet in Zimbabwe. At roughly $38 a month, its users get unlimited access to the internet.

 *[🌕] Seke Road Armed Robber Used Stolen Identity For 25 Years* 

FOLLOW THIS CHANNEL ✅
https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7XkovBvvsb5OoqEi1s

An armed robber who recently admitted to 35 counts of armed robbery committed along Seke Road had been using stolen identity for the past 25 years.

According to The Sunday Mail, the notorious criminal, Norman Sithole was arrested after robbing a motorist of US$250 and a cellphone.

Sithole only confessed moments before he was sentenced by magistrate Batanai Madzingira that the name appearing on the State papers was not his.


He had been using Anceloti Musengi’s national identity card for two and a half decades.

Musengi lost his ID in April 1998 at the Mbare Musika bus terminus while travelling to his rural home in Chirumhanzu, Midlands Province, for the Easter holidays.

Musengi, then aged 23, lost his wallet, which contained his national identity card, bank and medical aid cards, as well as cash as he jostled with other travellers to get a seat on a “Chicken Bus” to Midlands.

He only got to replace his ID card when he returned to Harare.

Musengi, who is employed by a renowned local financial institution, was to recover his original national identity card a fortnight ago after Sithole’s confession at the Mbare Magistrates’ Court.

Sithole did not state how he obtained Musengi’s ID card but confirmed that he got the identification particulars at Mbare Musika in 1998.

This led prosecutor Janet Mlambo to institute further investigations, which established that the convict was indeed telling the truth.

Sithole was subsequently slapped with a 40-year jail term. However, the court suspended three years and nine months on condition of good behaviour.

Another five years and five months were suspended on condition that Sithole pay back all the people he had robbed.

This means Sithole may serve a prison term of 30 years and 10 months.

Sithole’s reign of terror along Seke Road ended recently when he was arrested in Harare after robbing a local mechanic, Maurice Musiiwa, of US$250 and a cellphone.

On the day of the robbery, at around 8 PM, Musiiwa was driving a Mercedes-Benz C240 from Harare’s city centre to Chitungwiza along Seke Road.

As he slowed down to negotiate a pothole near the Delport turn-off, Sithole’s alleged accomplice, Walter Mapfumo, pretended to stumble and fall in front of his car, forcing him to stop.

Musiiwa disembarked from the car to find out what was happening and Mapfumo jumped to his feet and used a knife to force him to surrender all his belongings.

Sithole and Mapfumo then robbed Musiiwa of an Itel cellphone and a wallet with US$250.

Police investigations led to the recovery of an Itel S23, which had been sold to Mavis Nyambala, who later led police to Sithole.

Sithole then implicated Mapfumo as his accomplice. Mapfumo denied the charges, and is on remand awaiting trial.

*Follow Pindula on WhatsApp for daily new updates*

Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor Gideon Gono has responded to allegations raised by ZANU PF national spokesman, Chris Mutsvangwa, that a former central bank governor facilitated the “theft” of the country’s gold by Arabs.


During a press briefing in Harare on Monday, Mutsvangwa claimed that Zimbabwe’s gold reserves were taken out of the country during the tenure of the late President Robert Mugabe, and the RBZ Governor at the time, who he did not name, sought assistance from contacts in the Arab world, who said they could provide US dollars.

----------

Mutsvangwa added that an agreement was proposed wherein US dollars would be exchanged for Zimbabwe’s gold reserves.

Under the deal, Zimbabwe’s gold was to be transported from the RBZ’s vaults to a location abroad, allowing the Arab partners to verify the reserves.

Mutsvangwa said while the gold was transferred as per the agreement, the country never received the US dollars as per the agreement.

Gono refuted Mutsvangwa’s assertions, labelling them as “lies.” He explained that Mutsvangwa was Zimbabwe’s Ambassador to China, and he was misinformed about what really happened during the country’s financial crisis.

Below is Gono’s response to the allegations:


> “SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT: NO “GOLD RESERVES” WERE EVER STOLEN BY ANYONE DURING MY TENURE AS RBZ GOVERNOR UNDER FMR. Late President Robert Gabriel Mugabe’s WATCH.

> 1. Recent pronouncements by Hon. Chris Mutsvangwa, falsely alleging that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) lost an unspecified quantity of gold to an unnamed Arab country during the tenure of an “unnamed Governor”who”served under the late Former President R.G.Mugabe ( MHDSRIEP)put the Nation in a state of unnecessary frenzy . If such lies are left unchecked with authentic facts, they could become that “little spark” that sets alight a whole forest at a time when the Bank ( RBZ) and the country at large, have more important issues to deal with than waste time attending to veld-fires whose uncontrolled consequences could end up melting whatever confidence the Bank is trying to build around itself, the country and this great Nation at large… and how dare we dampen people’s spirits at this “ celebratory hour” with blatant lies!

> 2. Ordinarily, past Governors are not supposed to comment publicly on matters “current”which a sitting Governor is capable of dealing with regardless of which period those matters occurred. However in this case, I feel the need for leadership in dealing with this matter, so that there is we do not burden our new Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu or immediate past Governor Dr John Mangudya ,with an historical matter that I can easily deal with myself without “ambiguities “or the need to look for “sekuru Ndunge”( the late doyen of traditional healing and forecasting”to return from the other world so he can provide spiritual proclamations to something that is so straightforward, simple ( if we respect TRUTH)and explainable in plain, non-technical English.

> 3.If this explanation still proves difficult to understand, I would advocate that we ask His Excellency President E.D. Mnangagwa to set in a Commission of Inquiry in terms of the Commission of Inquiry Act( Chapter 10:07)incorporating all interested parties to look into this serious allegation of perfidious proportions and report to the Nation its Findings in simpler language than i would have done here.

> 4. Ordinarily too, no Governor would want to comment publicly on any matters he/ she dealt with while in Office because The Official Secrets Act( Chapter 11:09) by which binds and prohibits us from commenting on specific documentation recieved or matters of the State dealt with during our periods in Office(Section 4 is particularly telling ( level 14 fine or 20 years in jail or both if violated) but I am risking that by putting the record straight in a manner that cleans the image of the Nation’s Central Bank.

> 5. The third reason I have decided to take the bull by the horns is the ambiguous nature of the allegations, casting aspersions on many distinguished personalities who served as Governors under Former President RGM and still carry “scars and pride” of national service equal only to a few living souls around during one of the most difficult economic episodes of our country.

> 6. Their (Ex Governors) integrities ought to be respected and protected in retirement, as well as those the Hon. Ministers of Finance under whom they served and reported to. It is my duty to set the record straight for their sake as well as mine, so that our new Governor does not take his eyes off the “ZiG ball” to go into the archives of 18 years ago, searching for files and records for a response to this little fire that has deliberately or inadvertently been started with checking facts with all concerned.

> 7. For the record ,former Governors for the period concerned which excludes our inaugural independence Governor the late Dr K. Moyana( MHDSRIEP) ( 1983-93)are: Dr L. L. Tsumba( 1993-2003)part of the sanctions period 2001 to May 2003);Acting Governor Charles Chikaura( May 2003-November 2003);Acting Governor Dr Charity Dhliwayo ( December 2013-April,2014); Dr John Mangudya (May,2014-November 2017).These periods were under Late Fmr. President RGM. I am sure all of them have suffered some distress because the statement from the Hon. Ambassador Spokesperson was ambiguous as to who among us could have been that dump or daft! Now they can all sit back and tell their families and friends “ no it was not me whom was being referred to”!

> 8. I proudly served the longest of that sanctions period, 10 years in all, giving my country the best I could, from 1December 2003 to 30 November,2013 and it is natural to guess then who did what and when.

> UPFRONT…
9. Upfront, in summary, let it be known by all that we are talking here of whatCOULD , if it had succeeded, have been a “structured gold-backed transaction “which required mining the gold from underground in the first place, then export it in exchange for funds that would have been delivered and repackaged “fourfold in the first place” involving international banks and all above board, but after the first transaction amounting to US$5m deposit was executed by RBZ, the transaction failed on the other side and all parties to the envisaged transaction reimbursed each other, with no prejudice incurred or suffered by any of the parties to the transaction and ultimately, no GOLD was mined from underground for further export in terms of the initial Agreement which is now causing a hullabaloo due people who were not part of the RBZ team trying to confuse the Nation instead of letting us is happily celebrate our 44th UHURU!One frowns at the timing of the release of such “ news” even if , by any stretch of imagination, it was true!We need a little bit of finesse and circumspection in the discharge of our duties when it comes to the dissemination that has potential to harm the reputations of others in our positions as leaders! Please.

> 10.That’s the summary but here are the details. Background… ————————-

> 11. Managing this economy during the period 2000 to 2017 was not a “ walk in the park” for any Governor. The full story is yet to be written about the trials and tribulations of the times but that is for another day.

> 12.Some of us got onto the Sanctions list in 2001 and so for 23 years we were not as free Zimbabweans as some amongst us. Again for another day. We will always come out of retirement and defend the country when someone tries to burn it by setting the record straight when necessary.

> 13. The country survived through a series of non conventional gymnastics at a time when it was easier to give up than to accept thankless national service with all its risks in an environment of severe sanctions, international isolation, mono-currency and politically driven hyperinflation. It was a period most people witnessed the futility of trying to turn around our economic fortunes in an environment of needless political confrontation and conflict among fellow citizens.Again, that’s for another day. The RBZ Gold Contract of 2006.

> 14. When making public statements from positions of authority, we must resist temptation to be excitable and ambiguous, particularly when dealing with matters that could harm the confidence of key institutions such as a Central Bank. Facts and full facts backed by understanding the technical side of the matters at hand as well as CONTEXT are important.

> 15. Faced with a “ no forex reserve” situation for both Government and industry, it was incumbent on the sitting Governor to find that forex by whatever legal means and be accountable for every move taken by the Central Bank and its officials. It was also important to keep the Principals, especially the President fully in the picture and to ensure that at the end of each year, the Bank’s books were audited by at least two of the big 5 external international audit firms and results submitted on time to the Minister of Finance and Parliament.

> 16. The RBZ, during my tenure, was at different times annually audited by Delloite & Touché, KPMG, Ernest & Young as well as by Kudenga & Co BDO. At no time during my ten years at the Bank did we get qualified accounts.

> 17. In May,2006 RBZ, after getting express approval from H.E. Cde. RGMugabe, entered into an Agreement with a large Jewelry Company based in Saudi Arabia.

> 18. The contract sought to provide Zimbabwe with an immediate cash injection of US$150m.At the same time, we negotiated with a large South African Bank to deposit that money with them as cash security in exchange for a Guarantee Line of Credit 4 times that amount i.e. US$600m which was to be used for importation of goods and services from South Africa particularly electricity, fuel, grain, fertilizers, mining inputs, machinery etc. in a 3 month revolving basis for 12-24 months as long as the cash backing was there.

> 19.The Guarantee was to cost us 1-2% negotiable at time of execution while the Saudi deal required us to supply over the same period a total of 200,000 Troy ounces of gold at a discount of 34% London Bullion price on day of trading/delivery.

> 20. The discount was on paper very steep but overally when we worked out the sums against the imminent risks that were facing us, we saw ultimate benefit to this economy through the multiplier effect of running the $600m facility on a 3 months cycle for 24 months against gold which was still UNDERGROUND worth between $140-150m to be supplied over a 24 month period while the economy got $600m for immediate use 8 times at a cost of day 1,5%per annum fees. Here is the arithmetic: ——

> 21. It is over ten years since I left RBZ but I still have the conceptual framework in my mind of what was going to happen if it had worked and I am still an Accountant and banker at heart: 200,000 Troy Ounces value $150m ———— Cost( Discount)34% 51m Guarantee Fees to SA Bank 18m ———— Total Facility cost over 2yrs $69m ———— Income Side: ——————- Raising Fees charged to Zim Customers per quarter: 0,0075x$600 x 8 =. $36m Interest @ 5% /quarter. $60m Interest on int. & Fees 7m ————- Total Income to the Bank $103m Less cost of Facility. (69m) ————— Net Income to RBZ. $34m —————- Equivalent to a gain of 50,000 Troy ounces of gold in the 2 years the facility was planned to run for.

> 22. That amount would have been more than sufficient for the Bank’s iwn operating expenses without the need to knock on Treasury for support from tax-payers funds!

> 23. The Bank was required to pay $5m worth of Gold as a deposit and this was paid. When the lender couldn’t deliver the cash backing per contract, the Agreement was canceled and RBZ got back its US$5m.No prejudice to anyone.

> 24. It is important to also realize that we were dealing with an internationally recognized Jeweler and the Saudis are generally very honest people. And to say “ our gold reserves was stolen “ is wrong. We despatched about 7500 or so Troy Ounces worth $5m. We got back our $5m. At that time, in May, gold price was about $700/oz.if I’m not mistaken. Some Basics.

> 25. What is the meaning of Gold Reserves?

> 26.The term RESERVES generally refers to any surplus to immediate requirements.

> 27. Gold Reserves in this case would mean that RBZ had accumulated at some stage, surpluses to its immediate needs but nothing could be further from the truth… I got into a car that had no fuel on 1 December 2003 and I did my best to drive it on empty.

> 28. The Saudi contract was going to be fulfilled over a 12-24 months from incremental gold coming from the ground. We had done our homework as far as who the off-takers of the facility were going to be. It was not a blind shot so to speak.

> 29. To then mislead the public by saying RBZ lost the Nation’s “ Gold Reserves” is surely technically wrong and dangerous, worse when we seek to badmouth and besmirch the dead. Inga zvinonzi “ wafa Wa aka” wani? Why this penchant towards hate-speech against those you were with in the bush but never against Ian Smith? Nobody has bothered to find out how the RBZ was being run during the 15 years of sanctions and what some of us found in whatever records remained in there.

> 30. I certainly am not a direct descendant of St Peter or any of the Apostles who probably did not make mistakes but whatever mistakes my Team and I made during my tenure were neither deliberate nor fraudulent as all the audited set of books during my time there can attest. The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission( ZACC).

> 31. It is this same kind of irresponsible talk we witnessed from Hon. Ambassador Chris Mutsvanga who also happens to be my uncle, which in September/October 2021 led to ZACC spending public money and hours on a wild-goose chase after an anonymous someone misled ZACC to think the same way Zimbabweans have been emotionally whipped to think likewise.

> 32. ZACC carried out extensive investigations into this matter under Ref. 58/12/20 and 102/11/20 examining documents and interviewing RBZ Governor Mangudya, Mr Azvinandaa Saburi ( Director of Financial Markets who signed the Contract with Saudis under my authority) and others including myself in September 2021 and concluded that everything was above board and that there was no prejudice to anyone including RBZ and the Nation at large. Need to verify full facts .

> 33. It is key and important for people entrusted to speak on behalf of important organizations and political parties to always check their facts thoroughly for the sake of their own credibilities and that of others.

> 34. I forgive my sekuru for he was misled into believing that something was really amiss and more importantly, he was in the People’s Republic China as our Ambassador at the time we were battling to sort this economy out so he wouldn’t have been aware of some of the difficulties we went through to try and raise funding, including that required to support our esteemed embassies.

> 35. This country could benefit more from our individual and combined efforts if we sincerely direct them towards what our President, H.E. E.D. Mnangagwa and the Second Republic are trying very hard under difficult circumstances to achieve than to engage in blame-games that will not strengthen our new currency or take us foward especially during the country’s period of UHURU brought about by my sekuru and others.

> 36. Happy 44th to us All. I cherish the wonderful work being done by the Second Republic and salute all our National Heroes and Heroines, gallant fighters of our Liberation War, Mujibhas and Chimbwidos.

> 37. Be advised ALL, that no gold was lost during my time as Governor.

> Dr Gideon Gono.

> RBZ Governor During Biting Sanctions: (2003-13).

> 17 April, 2024.

25/04/2024, 10:29 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Starlink applies for Zim licence: The Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) says
the global satellite internet provider, Starlink, which is owned by American tycoon, Elon Musk, has applied to operate in
the country. Potraz director-general Gift Machengete revealed this in Bulawayo on Tuesday during a question-and-answer
session at a business function organised by the Ministry of Information Communication Technology (ICTs), Postal and
Courier Services on the sidelines of the ongoing 64th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). Starlink has
become a topic of concern in the country’s ICT sector, with questions being raised on how it operates given its continued
consumer growth and popularity worldwide. Responding to the issue, Machengete said the regulator was seized with the
matter and was processing the application papers by Starlink. “Then, why is Starlink not operating right now? The simple
answer is Starlink had not applied and we would be foolish to then go and say come and apply, please. “Now they have
come to apply and we are in the process of looking at their application,” said Machengete – Herald, Thursday April 25, Pg

28/04/2024, 07:07 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: *Govt Raises Tax-free Income Tax Threshold*

The Government has raised the monthly tax-free income tax threshold to about Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG)1 356.


This comes after the Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL), which was replaced by ZiG this month, had depreciated sharply during the first quarter of the year.

----------

As reported by NewsDay, the depreciation meant that the monthly tax-free income tax threshold, at ZWL750 000, translated to US$28,39 at the end of the quarter, way below the cost of living.

This drop was from the US dollar/Zim dollar equivalent of nearly US$74, at the end of January 2024, when the tax-free income tax threshold of ZWL750 000 came into effect.

On Friday, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube, issued Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 74 of 2024, stating that the monthly tax-free income tax threshold is ZiG1 356, about US$100.

This figure was calculated from the figure of ZiG12 204 as stated in the SI covering the period April 5 2024 to December 31 2024.

The S.I. says those earning between ZiG12 204,01 to ZiG36 612, over the same period, would attract a 20% income tax.

Those earning between ZiG36 612,01 to ZiG122 040 will attract a 25% income tax, ZiG122 040,01 to ZiG244 080 (30%), ZiG244 080,01 to ZiG366 120 (35%), and ZiG366 120,01 and above (40%).

In monthly terms, this translates to between ZiG1 356,01 to ZiG4 068 for the 20% income tax, ZiG4 068,01 to ZiG13 650 (25%), ZiG13 650,01 to ZiG27 120 (30%), ZiG27 120,01 to ZiG40 680 (35%), and ZiG40 680,01 and above (40%).

29/04/2024, 07:46 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Executive Power Couple: Why CEOs and CFOs Rule the Boardroom

In Zimbabwe and the rest of the world, the people who rule the boardroom are the CEO and CFO. Power is currency, and the boardroom is its trading floor.  It's no surprise that the two executives who wield the most financial clout, the CEO and CFO, are often the only ones from the executive team to sit on the board. Why? Because, let's face it, businesses are all about making money, and everything else matters less.

The CEO, the company's chief visionary and strategist, is the ultimate decision-maker responsible for steering the ship towards financial glory. And the CFO, the master of the financial universe, is the keeper of the keys, ensuring that every penny is accounted for and every investment turns a profit.

Together, this dynamic duo forms an unstoppable force, orchestrating the company's financial symphony. They are the yin and yang of corporate success, the brains and the brawn, the dreamers and the doers.

So, while other executives may bring their expertise to the table, it's the CEO and CFO who truly hold the reins of power. And in the end, power is what matters most in the business game.

This is precisely why CFOs often get a headstart in the CEO role.

01/05/2024, 14:30 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: *Compulsory Car Radio Licence is Daylight Robbery*

Cabinet yesterday announced adoption of Principles to a Bill that would be extortionate to motorists in Zimbabwe, who already have to pay very high toll fees and pay a premium at the fuel pump.

Motorists are now required to have a ZBC radio licence (US$23) first before buying vehicle insurance. The government made the changes in a bid to improve revenue collection for loss making media conglomerate ZBC. 

Despite this fee being an unfair tax on already struggling citizens - most motorists use FM modulators to play music from their phones rather than listen to actual radio. Others play CDs while many now play music from their flash drives.

Furthermore, if this Bill is to become actual law - it would have to take into consideration that not all radio stations are affiliated to ZBC. In fact, most ex-Japanese vehicles do not tune into any ZBC frequency.

Therefore, the money would have to benefit all radio stations in the country. ZBC radio stations would have to share the revenue with other national stations such as Star FM and ZiFM, and the provincial and community radio stations.

People have also been asking what happens if someone does not have a radion in their car; this is where it gets messy: one would be required to get an exemption from ZBC - opening floodgates for corruption and other abuses of the facility.

02/05/2024, 17:30 - +263 77 482 5076: 🟣Governor John Mushayavanhu’s reign of confusion continued today as he made yet another U-turn on his Monetary Policy Statement issued barely a month ago. Whereas he had originally announced that the Zimbabwe Dollar and bond notes would circulate until the 30th of April 2024 whereupon they’d cease to be legal tender, he now says bond notes and the ZWL will continue in use indefinitely and “co-circulate” with his ZiG. 

What does this mean for banking and business? Nobody knows. 

This is what happens when policies are implemented without consultation and clear thinking. The confusion of mind exhibited since he started does not bode well for confidence. The lack of certainty around the new currency over the last three weeks is bad for the economy. It’s impossible to plan because things keep changing arbitrarily. 

When we demanded a properly enacted legal framework for the new currency, this is the chaos we hoped would be avoided. Alas. 

It’s a mess.

We need new leaders.🇿🇼

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has gazetted new Intermediated Money Transfer Tax (IMTT) rates for Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) and United States dollars (USD).


Both are now at 2% removing the distortions different rates were having on pricing when applying interbank rates. Previously, it was 2% for local currency and 1% for USD.

----------

This comes after businesses have pleaded with authorities to either reduce the IMTT or scrap it altogether.

Businesses argued that IMTT was a significant additional cost given the several taxes already levied on businesses, therefore the tax had the effect of pushing up the prices of goods and services.

As reported by The Sunday Mail, IMTT is a tax levied on electronic payments or transfers made by either an individual or corporate entity.

The tax does not affect the receiver of the payment but the payer transacting to settle obligations for goods and services received.

Treasury announced the new changes to IMTT through Statutory Instrument 80 of 2024, which reads:


> IT is hereby notified that the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion has, in terms of section 3 of the Finance Act [Chapter 23:04], made the following regulations:-

> 1. These regulations may be cited as the Finance (Amendment of Sections 22B and 22G) Regulations, 2024.

> Amendment of Section 22B

> 2. Section 22B (“Automated Financial Transactions Tax”) is amended by the repeal of Section 22B(a) and substitution with the following-

> “(a) for each withdrawal above the local currency equivalent of one hundred United States dollars, a local currency equivalent of zero comma zero five United States dollars.”.

> Amendment of Section 22G

> 3. Section 22G (“Intermediated Money Transfer Tax”) is repealed and substituted by-

> “22G Intermediated Money Transfer Tax

> The intermediated money transfer tax chargeable in terms of –

> (a) section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two on every Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable:

> Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of five hundred thousand United States dollars (at the prevailing interbank rate) a flat intermediated money transfer tax of the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of ten thousand one hundred and fifty United States dollars (at the prevailing interbank rate) shall be chargeable on such transaction; or

> (b) section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two on every United States dollar or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable:

> Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds five hundred thousand United States dollars a flat intermediated money transfer tax of ten thousand one hundred and fifty United States dollars shall be chargeable on such transaction; or

> (c) section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two United States dollars on every dollar of every outbound foreign payment or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable;

> (d) section 36G(3) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two United States dollars on every Zimbabwe gold-backed digital token or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable.”

07/05/2024, 07:37 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Top eye specialist loses US$108 000 in crypto deal: Renowned eye specialist Solomon Guramatunhu allegedly lost US$108 924 to a crypto currency trader. Lloyd Chiyangwa (31) appeared before Harare regional magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa, who remanded him in custody pending bail ruling. He is also challenging his placement on remand. Prosecuting, Lancelot Mutsokoti alleged that sometime in 2020, Guramatunhu bought crypto currency while in India from a company in the United Kingdom. He returned to Zimbabwe where he engaged Chiyangwa, who trades in crypto currency. Chiyangwa was tasked to set up wallets and five accounts namely Trust, Exodus, Cosmostation, Wemix and Metamask and to set up passwords for these wallets. Between January 7 and January 27, 2024 Chiyangwa transferred 122,467 matic tokens worth US$108 924.24 from Guramatunhu’s Metamask wallet to Waybit exchange. The court heard that Guramatunhu discovered that the tokens were stolen on January 27, 2024 when he intended to move them into another wallet. Chiyangwa is suspected to have used his cellphone to make the transaction. The suspect has other pending court cases where he is facing similar charges – Herald, Tuesday May 7, Pg 5

Mafume said the rehabilitation of roads has heavily affected people living in areas like Harare West where the roads that lead to the New Parliament building in Mt Hampden are situated. Said Mafume:


> We need to urgently address this issue with the Minister of Transport. The works on the city centre roads and those leading to the new Parliament have worsened the situation.

> We had been promised that upgrading of Julius Nyerere would take just three weeks but now it’s more than two months.

> People are spending 4 hours going to work and another 4 hours going back home. Many are failing to get to the airport on time, some are missing important engagements.

> The traffic situation is terrible, something has to be done. The residents are suffering.


Mafume said he might also seek an audience with the companies doing the road rehabilitation for them to state their timelines.

At least 40 greater roads in and around the city have been lined up for the rehabilitation exercise.

The roads where the ministry shall apply asphaltic concrete overlay includes Samora Machel (Jaggers to Kuwadzana Roundabout), Dieppe roundabout, Glenara/Samora junction, Glenara/ED Mnangagwa Road, Chiremba (through Braeside), Robert Mugabe/Abdel Gamal Nasser, Josiah Tongogara, Harare Drive roundabout Jaggers, Lomagundi Road (selected sections), Simon Muzenda Street/Robert Mugabe junction to Tongogara Road, and Simon Muzenda Street/Robert Mugabe junction to Tongogara Road.

11/05/2024, 19:19 - Chipo CBZ: Its sad there is a teacher who has been arrested for swipping for someone at Pick n Pay and then used a rate of 15 to get his USD instead of bank rate. The person swipped for is a law enforcement officer deployed under cover to weed out people using unofficial rate. We may be  put in an awkward situation by people we think we are helping🙆🏻‍♂️.
