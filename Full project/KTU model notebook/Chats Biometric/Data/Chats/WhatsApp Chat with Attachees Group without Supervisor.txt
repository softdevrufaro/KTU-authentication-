27/03/2024, 21:27 - Sarah: We are concerned about the science behind the the alerts. The technology behind. Whatever that you wil use must no be so shallow since you are a part 3 student.Sending an alert is not a problem,  but coming up with an algorithm/or whatever you can call it  that can learn  that environment in real time and predict in realtime and send an alert that we need urgent maintainance and attention. If it's real time monitoring I will be ok with it

28/03/2024, 07:52 - Rufaro: you see the problem for me personally is that at the end of the day sir was no longer really pleased by how i continued to to change projects with his criticism and each session we had when he mentioned whether or not h
28/03/2024, 07:53 - Rufaro: *whether or not that we would listen if he spoke to us there is a possibility that he meant me which is why i have decided that to stick to my current project but i will just have to make changes that he approves of i am hoping something will turn out well but pakatoipa even at my end as well. so tongoshingirira
