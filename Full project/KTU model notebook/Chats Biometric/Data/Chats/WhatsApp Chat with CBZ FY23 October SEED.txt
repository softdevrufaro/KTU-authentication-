NSSA Mail
‚Äã
Dear Colleagues,


Please be advised that Harare Gardens has become criminally ridden of late as there are two puzzling murder cases recorded that occurred in broad daylight recently where armed robbers stabbed two victims on separate occasions using sharp objects to subdue victims into submission to hand over their valuables such as phones and handbags. This is indeed scary taking into account that we are juxtaposed with Harare Gardens, and we urge NSSA staff and surrounding neighbours to immediately desist from using Harare Gardens as a thoroughfare to either access passport offices or other related places close to Harare Gardens. Please take heed, life is precious and don‚Äôt be a statistic. 

 

Kind regards,

 

Security
