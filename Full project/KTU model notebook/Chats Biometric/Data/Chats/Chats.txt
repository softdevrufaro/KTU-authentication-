Whatever that you wil use must no be so shallow since you are a part 3 student.Sending an alert is not a problem,  but coming up with an algorithm/or whatever you can call it  that can learn  that environment in real time and predict in realtime and send an alert that we need urgent maintainance and attention. If it's real time monitoring I will be ok with it

Let me do my job 

And  teach a little about  work
01/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 78 001 7053: One hot afternoon  I went for 


A practical lesson  

Woodwork to be precise  

And i did use a lot of energy 

Because  we were nearing the lunch hour
01/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 78 001 7053: I lost track of time 

And I arrived  ku hostel

Pour down  My eyes 

And zvarwaidza kupfura heartbreak
01/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 001 7053: My brother  found  me crying 

Like  someone  on a funeral 

And he did show  some flames  to the culprit

No 

Results 

Ha it becomes  really  really  painful
01/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 78 001 7053: Today i want to teach  

About  WORK 

By God's  grace
01/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 78 001 7053: People  substitute  

Work with prayer

But the Word Work 

Appears first before  Prayer

In our Bibles
01/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 78 001 7053: So the Bible  begins  with a lecture  

Of the Work  of God 

It describes  what it means 

When we say Mwari  vanobata basa
01/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 77 442 6999: But Why uchidaro soo😂
01/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 78 001 7053: If we journey  in Genesis  2 vs 2 we find  out  that  Genesis Chapter  is a summary  of God's  work



By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
01/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 78 001 7053: So the  first  thing  

We need  to establish  

Is the fact  that 

We are a product  of God's  work❤️
01/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 77 442 6999: And to make matters worse I was tt friend who ate tt plate😂😂😂😂
01/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 78 001 7053: Confession😂😂😂😂
01/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 78 001 7053: We reflect  

The works of  God ❤️

01/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 78 001 7053: Secondly 

The  first  assignment  given to man 

Was not  to pray 

Or to love

Or to worship
01/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 78 001 7053: The first  thing  

God requested  from us 

Was to work
01/05/2024, 20:02 - +263 78 001 7053: If we travel  to the book  of Genesis  2 vs 15 

We see it clearly labeled  out 

Genesis  2 vs 15


The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to *work* it and take care of it.
01/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 78 001 7053: So there's no such  thing  as unemployment  to God 

God created  each of us to work
01/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 78 001 7053: And when  you work 

With alignment  to what God wants 

You get a reward
01/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 78 001 7053: Thirdly  

You are a product  of your parent's  work 😮
01/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 78 001 7053: Let me 

Surprise  you 👀
01/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 78 001 7053: You were not bought  

In a shop😂😂😂
01/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 78 001 7053: You 

Didn't  fall from heaven
01/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 78 001 7053: You 

Were not picked from the ground
01/05/2024, 20:06 - +263 78 001 7053: But 

Your parents  

Worked for you 😍❤️
01/05/2024, 20:07 - +263 78 001 7053: Through  

Courtship  

Through lobola  and marriage 

Through  the honeymoon  

Through  the pregnancy  stage 

Through  the labor  room
01/05/2024, 20:08 - +263 78 001 7053: Through  the 

School fees 

The meals 

The clothes  

Our parents 

Worked or are Working  for us
01/05/2024, 20:08 - +263 78 001 7053: If you love your parents 

Can you please react with this emoji

01/05/2024, 20:11 - +263 78 001 7053: My High School 

Principal  would  insult all the notorious  students 

By saying  uri usiku hwakatambiswa😂😂
01/05/2024, 20:11 - +263 78 001 7053: Let me now get  

To the fulcrum  of My story
01/05/2024, 20:13 - +263 78 001 7053: Allow  me to introduce to you 

That there's  a difference  between  Working  for God 

And  having  God  work  for you
01/05/2024, 20:14 - +263 78 001 7053: We have  a class  of people 

Who work for God
01/05/2024, 20:14 - +263 78 001 7053: And a class of people 

Who God works for
01/05/2024, 20:15 - +263 78 001 7053: As Tinashe  Mugabe  preaches

Nevanoshandirwa na Mwari
01/05/2024, 20:17 - +263 78 001 7053: The most dangerous  thing  creation  can do 

Is to associate  itself 

With the work  that God didn't  allow  you to do <This message was edited>
01/05/2024, 20:18 - +263 77 300 6134: ❤️
01/05/2024, 20:19 - +263 78 001 7053: Satan was 

Employed by God to sing  

But in the book of Isaiah  

We find him 

Creating  another  job for himself  

That had no God in it
01/05/2024, 20:20 - +263 78 001 7053: Isaiah 14 vs 13 

Lays out a plan 

Of how Satan planned  to work  against  God
01/05/2024, 20:21 - +263 78 001 7053: Isaiah  14 vs 13



You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.
01/05/2024, 20:22 - +263 78 001 7053: It might  excite you to 

Know  that work doesn't  

Begin  with hands 

But  it begins  by planning  

In the head
01/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: So Satan in Isaiah  14 vs 13 

Had already  started working  against God
01/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: Some of us are working  

Against  God
01/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: We say in our hearts

😮😮😮 I will invite  her in my room
01/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 78 001 7053: I will kiss her 

Then sleep  with her
01/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Some say 

I will  borrow  money  

I will not return  it 

I will buy beer with  it
01/05/2024, 20:25 - +263 78 001 7053: Some say I will buy data 

I will wait  for all to sleep  

Then i will watch pornography
01/05/2024, 20:26 - +263 78 001 7053: Satan had 7 I will plans 

😮😮

But it's scary  how some of us have 

More than 50 I will plans 

Against  the works of God <This message was edited>
01/05/2024, 20:29 - +263 78 001 7053: I was reading  the book  of our great  brother  in here

The people  who work for God 

For show off
01/05/2024, 20:31 - +263 78 001 7053: The people  who 

Work for God 

So that they feel  better  than other 

People
01/05/2024, 20:31 - +263 78 258 5433: True
01/05/2024, 20:31 - +263 78 001 7053: People  who don't  work for  God 

From the heart 

But work for God to prove a point
01/05/2024, 20:32 - +263 78 001 7053: This 

Class doesn't  get  a reward

From God

01/05/2024, 20:36 - +263 78 001 7053: When 

Abraham  obeyed 

God promised  to work  

For him
01/05/2024, 20:37 - +263 78 001 7053: It's captured  in the  book  of 

Genesis  12
01/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: Genesis  12 vs 2


"I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
01/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: God will  make you a nation 

He will  bless  you 

He will  make  your name great  

He will make  you a blessing
01/05/2024, 20:40 - +263 78 001 7053: 12 vs 3


I will bless those who bless you,

 and whoever curses you I will curse;

 and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
01/05/2024, 20:41 - +263 78 001 7053: Ladies  and Gentlemen 

We can make  

God work for us
01/05/2024, 20:42 - +263 78 001 7053: The reward

01/05/2024, 20:44 - +263 78 001 7053: Work 

Is not an old testament  philosophy
01/05/2024, 20:44 - +263 78 001 7053: We see it mentioned  by 

Paul
01/05/2024, 20:45 - +263 78 001 7053: Romans  8 vs 28


And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
01/05/2024, 20:47 - +263 78 001 7053: God works  for  those who love him 

And if you  love  me follow  my commandments
01/05/2024, 20:47 - +263 78 001 7053: And our commandment 

And work  this week  is

Things may turn down a bit, 
But that may not be the end
Just hang on as best will come 
Just be there to see a change 
Don't feel radical or strange 
As you deserve the best in life 
Just be there!

02/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: Tonight we are going to talk about 

*The Light  of creativity*
02/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: First we have to understand what creativity is
02/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 71 944 6004: And the best definition of creativity 

Is *Creativity is who God is*
02/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: God gave each of us talents and creative minds
02/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: The first verse in the Bible says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and earth” 

Genesis 1:1
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: God is Creator

And He formed us in His image

so we’re creative too
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: Therefore the power to create is in us all
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: Each of us is not just a precious creation of God

But we are powerful creators with God
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: We have ability to use our light to create in every area of our lives
02/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: So out of light God created us and placed us in the Garden of Eden on earth which was also created out of light
02/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: So we are called to create something out of what already exists
02/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: Creating new ideas for his kingdom 
framing new attitudes and building new relationships for his glory
02/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: In Ephesians 2:10

we discover how we reflect God’s creativity

Paul reminds us we are God’s creation
02/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 71 944 6004: ”For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.“
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2‬:‭10
02/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 71 944 6004: We often think about creativity only in terms of arts etc
02/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 71 944 6004: But creativity is so much more than that

When we use our God given abilities to solve the problems we face in the world we are tapping into what it means to reflect the image of God
02/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 71 944 6004: And we will be producing light
02/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 71 944 6004: The light which comes from creativity
02/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 71 944 6004: So seeing God in a more creative light invites us to hear and move freely to the creativeness of the gospel
02/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 71 944 6004: We notice that the closer people got to Jesus

The more imaginative and daring they seemed to become
02/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 71 944 6004: Peter did not try walking on water 

Until he saw Jesus doing it
02/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 71 944 6004: Martha had not wondered about her brother coming back from the dead 


Until she heard what Jesus had in mind
02/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 78 866 0500: Amen
02/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 71 944 6004: There was no following Jesus without taking in and taking on the wild and wonderful possibilities he inspired day in and day out
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 71 944 6004: The good news is that being in Christ makes us not only new creations but also new creators
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 71 944 6004: Because he gives you the Light
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 77 442 6999: Amen
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 71 944 6004: Did you know you are called by God to be creative? 

If so how are you answering that call?
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: So tonight I have come to encourage someone to be creative
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: Because it produces light
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: This is a season of Light
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 77 402 5094: Following
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: Don’t sit on your light
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 77 402 5094: *LIGHT*
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 71 944 6004: Make it shine
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 77 402 5094: These are nuggets
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 71 944 6004: Be creative
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 71 944 6004: Invest in the things of the kingdom for the production of your light and creativity
02/05/2024, 20:02 - +263 71 944 6004: The Bible says 

John 1:5 – “The light shines in the darkness. But the darkness has not overcome the light.”
02/05/2024, 20:02 - +263 71 944 6004: There’s something about this light
02/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 71 944 6004: God created the earth without the light of the sun because he didn’t need light he is the light
02/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 71 944 6004: And so are you
02/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 71 944 6004: Don’t wait for something extraordinary to come 

To become great
02/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 71 944 6004: Your light is already bright 

I pray the Lord shows us all how we can use the light that comes through us being creative for good works
02/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 71 944 6004: This is a different type of light 

The light of creation the light from the head
02/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 77 442 6999: Amen
02/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 71 944 6004: Good night 

You are loved 🙏🏽❤️

02/05/2024, 22:43 - +263 78 669 9867: Powerful books 

l haven't read the second one though 🔥🫴🫴
02/05/2024, 22:45 - +263 78 814 7058: The first quality wise men should look out for in a
woman is the fear of the Lord. When I say fear of
the Lord, I don't just mean that she goes to church,
I don't just mean that she carries the bible, I don't
just mean that she prays, I mean she is a woman
that holds God in reverence and has a living,
breathing relationship with Him. Listen very
carefully, whether you are a man or woman, what
will sustain that marriage till the end is a personal
relationship with God, not with your spouse. I'm
not saying don't have a personal relationship with
your spouse, but your relationship with God must
supersede that.
Joseph had the chance to sleep with Potiphar's wife
but he said, "How can I do this great wickedness
and sin against God."(Gen 39:9). The issue was not
about Potiphar. Potiphar would not have known,
but Joseph had the fear of God. Listen, your spouse
will not do some certain things to you or against
you if they fear God.
My wife doesn't just submit to me all the time
because I'm saying what she likes, no. The bible
says you should submit because you are a wife.
(Ephesians 5:22) and that's what she's practicing.
The woman is not just submitting because she
believes or because she agrees with everything the
man is saying, no! She submits because she wants
to honor God and honor God's word!
Just the same way the Bible says the woman should
submit, the Bible also says as a man, you should love your wife! (Ephesians 5:25) That means you
put her first! That means that sometimes you don't
feel like doing certain things, but because you fear
God and you want to honor God, you do those
things. You need to understand that if the person
you want to marry is doing everything he or she is
doing just because of you, the day you annoy them
there will be consequences.

But love is a person
03/05/2024, 08:24 - +263 78 001 7053: It's a tragedy  

When you find  someone  who  is incomplete  as a partner <This message was edited>
03/05/2024, 08:25 - +263 78 001 7053: Someone  who lost  

Parts of him or herself  

Through  their  past
03/05/2024, 08:27 - +263 78 001 7053: Last week  we managed  to establish  

That when  people  have  sexual  relations  

A part  of them is taken away
03/05/2024, 08:28 - +263 78 814 7058: Yes
03/05/2024, 08:29 - +263 78 001 7053: Genesis  2 vs 24 was our anchor  verse 

And  we managed  to diagnose  that the more a person  sleeps with people  

The higher the chances  they lose  part of themselves
03/05/2024, 08:31 - +263 78 001 7053: That's why there's a proliferation  of divorce  cases these days 

Because  people  can't  compete  each other any more 

The sexual  milage  of people  has become a concern
03/05/2024, 08:33 - +263 78 001 7053: Although  this  revelation  was hard to digest  

We found  that through  the Holy  communion  

Through  the blood  of Jesus  our  sins are forgiven

And through  the bread or flesh  of Jesus  we are made complete
03/05/2024, 08:35 - +263 78 001 7053: As we are gathering  together  tomorrow  

We all get a chance  to be made whole  again

Why
No respect
Trust betrayal

Then haaa ane demon toita plan tingatorara kugomo kusvika rarova pasi.


In conclusion cheating is worse because it is y plus x (& x not zero) where as demon is just y.

03/05/2024, 13:25 - +263 71 142 4091: its because the day you die becomes the trademark of your nextlife........

05/05/2024, 06:45 - +263 78 123 5470: When the time is right, God is going to move you from the back row to the front row and bless you in the presence of your enemies. He is going to lift you from grass to Grace and from breakthrough to breakthrough. A time is coming where you are going to forget about all the struggles you have been through, you are going to forget about all the sorrows and pains because God is going to bless you so much. Be inspired, be encouraged, be optimistic and believe God for a brighter future. May God go into your future and arrange everything in your favor as the Holy spirit continues to lead the way in Jesus’ Name.

_INSPIRED BY ISAIAH 60:22_

Muduku achava chiuru, akadukupa achava rudzi rune simba; ini Jehovha ndichakurumidza kuzviita nenguva yazvo. 

60:22	The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the LORD; in its time I will do this swiftly."

06/05/2024, 13:40 - +263 77 300 6134: And one of the ways we learnt was how his shadow comes first before his arrival
06/05/2024, 13:40 - +263 77 300 6134: Some of the darkness you go through is a preparation for the arrival of God in your life
06/05/2024, 13:42 - +263 77 300 6134: So you have to be able to see 


That this situation, it can only be God who is on the way ❤️
06/05/2024, 13:43 - +263 77 300 6134: When God arrives he shakes that which was already existing

06/05/2024, 13:44 - +263 77 300 6134: He comes and makes room for Himself
06/05/2024, 13:45 - +263 77 300 6134: So whatever you are going through

06/05/2024, 14:39 - +263 78 346 1988: Ini i say so  coz God didn't tell us if he started on Monday or Friday or any of those dates since they were man crafted ..so we cant pin point the exact date he started creation according to the days of the week . henceforth we can say u can choose your own date to set it as a Sabbath how ever a certain church made sartuday as their day and enforced the norm.to everyone which is not wrong so ur Sabbath can be Monday or Friday or Wednesday ..
06/05/2024, 14:40 - +263 78 346 1988: Its not that date that matter it's the amount of heart and spirit you put into the date to honour God

06/05/2024, 19:29 - +263 78 346 1988: My pastor is typing ..
06/05/2024, 19:29 - +263 71 944 6004: Today I will share a short teaching about Grace
06/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 71 944 6004: And I’m in the book of Genesis chapter 20
06/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 71 944 6004: The Story we have probably heard a couple of times
06/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 71 944 6004: The story of Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:31 - +263 71 944 6004: When he decieves Abimelech
06/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 71 944 6004: So today I learnt something in the morning about Grace and Saint Hennessy gave me the opportunity to teach tonight and Id like to share the word with you all ❤️
06/05/2024, 19:33 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Abraham introduced his wife, Sarah, by saying, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for Sarah and had her brought to him at his palace.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭2
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”But that night God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are a dead man, for that woman you have taken is already married!”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭3
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭4
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘Yes, he is my brother.’ I acted in complete innocence! My hands are clean.” In the dream God responded, “Yes, I know you are innocent. That’s why I kept you from sinning against me, and why I did not let you touch her.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭5‬-‭6
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Now return the woman to her husband, and he will pray for you, for he is a prophet. Then you will live. But if you don’t return her to him, you can be sure that you and all your people will die.”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭7
06/05/2024, 19:35 - +263 71 944 6004: So my message is coming from these scriptures
06/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 71 944 6004: Abimelech said to God I did this in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands
06/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 71 944 6004: And he said this because he hadn’t slept with Sarah
06/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 71 944 6004: And the Lord responded to him saying 

He knows his heart is pure
06/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 71 944 6004: But when it comes to the action of not doing wrong
06/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 71 944 6004: He kept him from sinning
06/05/2024, 19:39 - +263 71 944 6004: He was saying yes you were decieved 

You didn’t know that Sarah was a wife to Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:39 - +263 71 944 6004: But when it comes to you not sleeping with her
06/05/2024, 19:40 - +263 71 944 6004: He made him not sleep with her
06/05/2024, 19:40 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.“
‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5‬:‭23
06/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 71 944 6004: God is able to keep you blameless
06/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 71 944 6004: When it comes to being righteous
06/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 71 944 6004: It is something that you are made

Not something that you do
06/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 71 944 6004: God showed this through Abraham and Abimelech
06/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 71 944 6004: The Lord doesn’t want us to be moving as if we are being righteous in our own ways
06/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 71 944 6004: He makes us righteous
06/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 71 944 6004: The Lord was angry at Abimelech because he said


”But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭4
06/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 71 944 6004: He was now thinking he is an innocent nation

He had taken his innocence to national level 😂
06/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 71 944 6004: Yet the Lord made him innocent for the sake of Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 71 944 6004: That kind of mindset 

The Lord revealed to me that it is not what keeps our relationship with him
06/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 71 944 6004: When we look at ourselves higher than what God has made us 

Putting ourselves in positions where we take the Lord’s glory
06/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 71 944 6004: We might say 

I don’t sleep around with people 

I don’t go to clubs

I don’t fornicate but the Lord is saying
06/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 71 944 6004: I am the one keeping you from doing those sins
06/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 71 944 6004: So we must stay humble enough to acknowledge that the Lord is making us righteous not our own works or ability
06/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 71 944 6004: God is saying don’t boast to me
06/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: And Abraham also had committed a sin
06/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: He lied
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: But even at that time God was with him protecting him
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: He did things out of fear
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: Yet in that moment the Lord made him a prophet
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: Before that we had no record of Abraham being a prophet
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: So even when you are wrong
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: The Lord is gracious
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: Even when you are not in the right position
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: I’m not encouraging you to do wrong 😂
06/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: But There is no part of Christian true living that is earned
06/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: It is given to us by the Holy Spirit
06/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: We are made righteous because God makes us righteous
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: We are made Holy because God calls us Holy
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: Abraham became a prophet because God named him a prophet
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: After that we see him operating as a Prophet
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: Showing that God is the one who makes us
06/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: Our Father has named each and every one of us and called us to be something
06/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: And by his grace we shall become what he has said like Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: Good night

06/05/2024, 21:34 - +263 78 692 6053: Those were Jesus' words that he told to the disciples concerning the last days 
What was going to happen in the last days 

Firstly he told them that everything that you see in this world will be destroyed and there's nothing, not anything, not even a stone will be left 

He told them that many people will come saying that they are the Messiah but don't believe them 
False prophets will rise and deceive people but don't listen to them 

He went on Saying that see I've told you ahead of time, but here it applies to us the present believers that we have to know all those things concerning the end times so that we may know what will happen 
So that we may be ready for his second coming before the Greatest tribulation 

When he comes, he will take others through rapture 
But those who are left behind will face this great tribulation 
Most people will lose faith but those who will endure to the end will be saved at the end 
He mentioned that the days of the tribulation were shortened because of the love of God 

On verse 35, he said that, this generation will not pass until these things happen
If you relate to what he had  said contextually, you'll realize that he had said that like in the days of Noah, when what was happening in the days of Noah starts happening now, just know that , it is that generation that will not pass ...


He boldly  told them that, his words will never pass away like the heavens and the earth 

Thank you
06/05/2024, 22:44 - +263 78 346 1988: We need to understand what was happening in the days of noah .there was eating marrying and drinking ..

06/05/2024, 23:11 - +263 78 001 7053: There's  a day where  you will call and  no one answers 

There's  a day when you  want to speak  and words won't  come out 

There's  a day when  hugs won't  be warm 

And compliments  will be meaningless

There's  a day when the lips  will fail to construct  any prayer 

There's  a day  when God feels far
06/05/2024, 23:23 - +263 78 001 7053: A day when  you won't 

Fit in the equation

You will allow  your seed  to speak for you
06/05/2024, 23:41 - +263 78 001 7053: Jesus  arrived  at a stage  where  prayer  was  difficult 

And he felt  empty
06/05/2024, 23:42 - +263 78 001 7053: But all he could  give  was his body  as a seed

07/05/2024, 18:59 - +263 71 944 6004: Tonight I’m going to teach about 

*THE GRACE OF GOD*🙏🏽
07/05/2024, 18:59 - +263 71 944 6004: This is our anchor scripture 

”he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;“
‭‭Romans‬ ‭4‬:‭20
07/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 78 258 5433: Ready🗒️
07/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 71 944 6004: The scripture is talking about Abraham
07/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 78 669 9867: Powerful
07/05/2024, 19:01 - +263 71 944 6004: It says Abraham staggered not at the promise
07/05/2024, 19:01 - +263 71 944 6004: To *stagger* is to move unsteadily as if about to fall
07/05/2024, 19:02 - +263 71 944 6004: The scripture says Abraham did not move unsteadily Abraham did not fall  at the promise
07/05/2024, 19:02 - +263 78 258 5433: Yessssss🔥📌
07/05/2024, 19:02 - +263 71 944 6004: You might be like me when I first read the scripture I was like how
07/05/2024, 19:03 - +263 71 944 6004: Because there’s an entire tribe from Ishmael from his fall he chose Hagar to give him a child since Sarah was barren
07/05/2024, 19:04 - +263 71 944 6004: And Abraham out of fear lied that Sarah was his sister to Kung Abimelech
07/05/2024, 19:04 - +263 71 944 6004: He questioned God he made his own solutions
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 71 944 6004: But when the Bible recorded about him

You would think  Abraham never made a mistake
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 71 944 6004: The Bible said he staggered not

It says he did not make any mistakes
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 78 258 5433: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 71 944 6004: Yet there’s people like Esau who made 1 mistake but the Bible calls him an infidel
07/05/2024, 19:06 - +263 71 944 6004: In the New Testament
07/05/2024, 19:06 - +263 78 258 5433: 🙆🏽‍♀️🔥
07/05/2024, 19:06 - +263 71 944 6004: An infidel is "unfaithful" a person who is accused of disbelief in their beliefs
07/05/2024, 19:07 - +263 71 944 6004: But Abraham hanzi he staggered not
07/05/2024, 19:07 - +263 71 944 6004: I was like Lord 

What was Hagar ? She’s a stagger 👀😂
07/05/2024, 19:07 - +263 71 944 6004: But because when God defines 

He doesn’t define you by what you’ve done
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 78 669 9867: Teach 🔥
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 71 944 6004: He defines you by what he has made you to be
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 71 944 6004: Holiness is not something you achieve
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 71 944 6004: Holiness is what you are made
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 78 342 0350: Yes🙏
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: ”And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy and complete for all time!“
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭10‬:‭14
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: He made us perfectly holy
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: It’s what he calls us
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: Abraham though he staggered in the Old Testament
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: But because he trusted God enough to make the line of Jesus
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: He was going to be defined after Jesus
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 348 5628: <Media omitted>
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: No matter what you’ve done in the past
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: No matter what you’re struggling with
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 78 258 5433: Ouuuuuuuuu🥵✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 71 944 6004: When God is going to talk about you
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 71 944 6004: It will be

Behold my holy child
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 78 258 5433: My Godddddd🥵🥵🥵
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 71 944 6004: And youll even be shocked yourself that what is Jesus saying does he know me
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: But because you believed in him
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: Though you never saw the actual cross he died on
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: Jesus celebrates your
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: I want someone to pray that the Lord helps them
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: To see themselves the way he sees them
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: Because if you see yourself from God’s perspective
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: Religion will irritate you
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: Religion calls you by your weaknesses
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: And it identifies you by your weaknesses
07/05/2024, 19:14 - +263 71 348 5628: <Media omitted>
07/05/2024, 19:14 - +263 71 944 6004: But Jesus calls you as

07/05/2024, 19:14 - +263 71 944 6004: Abraham staggered but because he was what God said he is
07/05/2024, 19:15 - +263 71 944 6004: He was perfect to God
07/05/2024, 19:15 - +263 71 944 6004: Only a Father can name a child
07/05/2024, 19:15 - +263 71 944 6004: Your Father has called you righteous
07/05/2024, 19:15 - +263 78 258 5433: This word is for me ✋🏽

08/05/2024, 08:20 - +263 78 001 7053: The strongest team in the world  is not Man City or Real Madrid 😮
08/05/2024, 08:21 - +263 78 001 7053: But the strongest  team in the world is 

The 

Praise and  Worship  team
08/05/2024, 08:22 - +263 78 001 7053: This team does not only  entertain  us 


But it connects  us deeper  to God
08/05/2024, 08:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Though  this team is powerful  

Sometimes  it kills the growth  of an average  believer  

To think  that praise  is achieved  through  singing  fast songs 

And worship  is attainable  when we sing  slow sweet  songs
08/05/2024, 08:25 - +263 78 001 7053: There are levels  in 

Everything  

And there's  rank in  every  place  you go 

Even Kuma humbwe 😂
08/05/2024, 08:26 - +263 78 001 7053: In trying  to find  meaning  in the Bible  there's  what is called  the Law of first mention 

Meaning  you consult  when the word was first used in the Bible
08/05/2024, 08:28 - +263 78 001 7053: The Word  worship  was first employed in Genesis  22 vs 25
08/05/2024, 08:30 - +263 78 001 7053: The  Word was used when Abraham  was selfless  to go and sacrifice  his own Son Issac  as a sign of Obedience  to God
08/05/2024, 08:31 - +263 78 001 7053: Thus  being  said  we can establish  that worship is beyond  singing  

Worship  beyond  sweet  words 

But the deepest  part of worship  is in sacrifice
08/05/2024, 08:31 - +263 78 001 7053: The Bible  then makes  it clear  to us 

That those  who worship  God must worship  in spirit  and Truth
08/05/2024, 08:32 - +263 78 001 7053: What God  desires  most 

Is Worship
08/05/2024, 08:33 - +263 78 001 7053: And it's sad that most of us 

Have wrongly  defined  worship  for decades
08/05/2024, 08:34 - +263 78 001 7053: This week 

God is being  gracious  enough  to afford  us an opportunity  

To worship  him 

Through  our substance ❤️🔥❤️
08/05/2024, 08:35 - +263 78 001 7053: Meaning  we are Giving  unto God 

Sacrificing  what we have  for the Kingdom  of God to be shared across  the world
08/05/2024, 08:36 - +263 78 001 7053: The List above  is comprising  of people  

Who understand the deep revelation  of what True  Worship is
08/05/2024, 08:37 - +263 78 001 7053: I am challenging  You 

And You 

To not allow  a moment  of deep worship  to pass ❤️
08/05/2024, 08:39 - +263 78 001 7053: Worship is in giving from your deepest  parts 

But the key element  of worship  is in timing ❤️
08/05/2024, 08:39 - +263 78 001 7053: Abraham  didn't  say I will sacrifice  my son when he has grown old or after  he is married  

He worshiped immediately
08/05/2024, 08:41 - +263 78 001 7053: If it's a dollar

And tell him what  you want to sacrifice  to the Lord
08/05/2024, 08:48 - +263 78 001 7053: I will tell you this 

🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾
08/05/2024, 08:50 - +263 78 001 7053: Before  God greatly uses you 

To impact  the World  

He will award  you an opportunity  to be used by him through Giving
08/05/2024, 09:28 - +263 78 001 7053: Upon discussing  with my friend  he said ko isu vema dollar vasingade kuiswa pa list

08/05/2024, 12:48 - +263 78 001 7053: How do you think  God feels when he blesses you with something  

And you are not willing  to give it back  to him 

😮😮😮
08/05/2024, 12:49 - +263 77 479 9966: Jealous
08/05/2024, 12:49 - +263 78 001 7053: You use the gift or blessing  he gave you 

And share  that gift to your personal desires  or wants 

When Jesus  is need of that thing
08/05/2024, 12:50 - +263 78 001 7053: Will your bae be motivated  to give you more when you share it with everyone

Be comfortable  to give you above  what you have  

When you use the little  gifts he has given you to satisfy  self

Or you will become  a Abraham ❤️🔥
08/05/2024, 12:56 - +263 78 001 7053: As I am speaking  the spirit  of God is moving  in people's  hearts and minds 

And it's  whispering  amounts  and things to sacrifice  

Be foolish  enough  to obey

08/05/2024, 13:10 - +263 78 038 1294: 🥺

Together with some issues
08/05/2024, 13:12 - +263 78 001 7053: I preached to her and gave her testimonies  

To build her faith 

And left her with a promise  that all will be well

As I was walking  back  to my room 

The Lord led me to tell someone  in our Church  her story  

And she is getting help

If you know  kuti the Judge or the person asking  you 

Can inflict  punishment
08/05/2024, 18:46 - +263 78 001 7053: The punishment  came in various  forms 

To some it came in beatings 

To some in restrictions 

To some in verbal  insults
08/05/2024, 18:47 - +263 78 026 5054: Yes

08/05/2024, 18:48 - +263 78 001 7053: Every  home has rules 

Every  home has laws 

So we were all lawyers  at some  time 

Defending  ourselves  or our siblings
08/05/2024, 18:48 - +263 77 442 6999: 🤚🏼

08/05/2024, 18:48 - +263 77 442 6999: Yes yes🔥
08/05/2024, 18:49 - Rufaro: Lawyers are some of the biggest risk takers know of there was one who told me of how he met up with a thief to discuss his possible defence and at the end of the session he noticed his car keys, wallet and phone were missing.
08/05/2024, 18:49 - +263 78 258 5433: Yes✅
08/05/2024, 18:49 - +263 78 001 7053: A court 

Can be a happy place
08/05/2024, 18:49 - +263 78 001 7053: A court 

Can be a sad place
08/05/2024, 18:49 - +263 78 001 7053: It just depends  on the 

Verdict
08/05/2024, 18:50 - +263 78 001 7053: The Bible  covers  

Different  court sessions  ❤️

08/05/2024, 18:52 - +263 78 001 7053: If we visit  the book  of Acts 4 

And Acts 5 we see 

2 different  court sessions
08/05/2024, 18:55 - +263 78 001 7053: There was a physical  court 

Session  

And a spiritual  court session
08/05/2024, 18:55 - +263 78 001 7053: I have  an ask

A physical  one 

Or 

A spiritual  one

?
08/05/2024, 18:56 - +263 78 001 7053: Wrong  answers  only

08/05/2024, 18:56 - Rufaro: Spiritual at least I have no need to make up a story to prove my innocence and I can be exonerated out of the most bizarre scenarios without a lawyer
08/05/2024, 18:57 - +263 78 001 7053: Alright
08/05/2024, 18:57 - Rufaro: Only downside is your first lie can decide your verdict there and then
08/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 78 026 5054: Inini Physical Court chaiyo inotondirwadza

'Have you tried my servant  prince'
08/05/2024, 19:17 - +263 78 001 7053: So when  Peter  healed  

A crippled  man 

He went into a court  session
08/05/2024, 19:21 - +263 78 001 7053: And the major  reason  of the court  session  was

The source  of Power  which Peter  used to heal
08/05/2024, 19:23 - +263 78 001 7053: Acts 4 vs 7


They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: "By what power or what name did you do this?"
08/05/2024, 19:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Peter then responded  in 4 vs 10



then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
08/05/2024, 19:24 - +263 78 258 5433: Following 📌
08/05/2024, 19:25 - +263 78 001 7053: The Judges were not  pleased  with answer
08/05/2024, 19:26 - +263 78 001 7053: But the most unfortunate  part for them 

There was no law written  down which  prohibited  people  from using  the power  of Jesus
08/05/2024, 19:27 - +263 78 001 7053: Hence these men could  not be put in prison
08/05/2024, 19:27 - +263 78 001 7053: The incident only  increased  

The influence  of Jesus
08/05/2024, 19:28 - +263 78 001 7053: It made them 

Heroes
08/05/2024, 19:28 - +263 78 001 7053: It totally  changed  their lives
08/05/2024, 19:29 - +263 78 001 7053: Before  the court session  

Peter and John  had no money
08/05/2024, 19:29 - +263 78 001 7053: Acts 3 vs 6


Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."
08/05/2024, 19:31 - +263 78 001 7053: But after  a successful  day in court 

We see people  selling  all they had
08/05/2024, 19:31 - +263 78 001 7053: To bring  to the feet 

Of  the Apostles
08/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 78 001 7053: Acts 4 vs 37


sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.
08/05/2024, 19:33 - +263 78 001 7053: Life has given  you 

Difficult  court sessions
08/05/2024, 19:33 - +263 78 258 5433: True
08/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 78 001 7053: People  have  asked  you 

What's  the benefit of prayer 

If your life is like this
08/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 78 001 7053: Sickness  has  asked you 

Where's  the power of Jesus  

If you and your mum are sick <This message was edited>
08/05/2024, 19:36 - +263 78 001 7053: Poverty  has asked  you 

What  is the benefit  of giving  in Church  

When you are still  broke
08/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 78 001 7053: The Devil  has been  presenting  a case 

To you 

Challenging  the spiritual  with your natural
08/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 78 001 7053: But in this season

Will be made bigger
08/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 78 001 7053: You will win 

The court cases against  your doubts
08/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 78 001 7053: You will win the court  cases

Against your enemies
08/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 78 001 7053: You will win the court  cases 

Against  the plans of Satan
08/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 78 001 7053: The brothers of Joseph  

Had a court case
08/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 78 258 5433: Amennnnnnnnnnnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾
08/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 78 001 7053: And provided the father 

With  the evidence  of the court of many colors
08/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 78 001 7053: But Joseph  followed  the way of the Spirit
08/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 001 7053: And 

His brothers Just like  what happened  to Peter 

Came to his feet
08/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 001 7053: They came with the reward of honor  on his feet 

The reward  of humility
08/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 001 7053: A lot might  have  been taken away from you
08/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 78 001 7053: But the Spirit  in you 

Is  alive
08/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 78 001 7053: And that spirit  

Will bring  you a kingdom
08/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 78 001 7053: A court case was made for Abraham  when a king  took his wife 

The lord  spoke  for his prophet and he received  his reward
08/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 78 001 7053: The Lord will represent  you 

In your absence
08/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 78 001 7053: The lord will energize  you to stand

08/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 78 001 7053: When Jesus  freed Peter from Jail 

Hid finances were also freed
08/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 78 001 7053: When Jesus  frees you from that little  prison  you are in today 

He will free you from other prisons

08/05/2024, 20:55 - +263 77 891 7712: *Problem:* 01001001 + 00101111

*Step 1:* Align the two binary numbers:

```
  01001001
+ 00101111
```

*Step 2:* Add each column from right to left:

```
  01001001
+ 00101111
------
  01110100
```

*Answer:* 01110100

Here's the calculation in each column:

- Rightmost column (2^0): 1 + 1 = 10 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^1): 0 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 10 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^2): 0 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 10 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^3): 1 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 11 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^4): 0 + 0 + 1 (carried) = 1
- Next column (2^5): 1 + 0 = 1
- Next column (2^6): 0 + 0 = 0
- Leftmost column (2^7): 0 + 0 = 0

08/05/2024, 23:28 - +263 78 814 7058: Usually when I talk about relationships I like to start
by saying this: it is not about getting married, it is
about being happily married. If it were about just
getting married to anybody, then you could as well go
to a native doctor or somebody to do something for
you just to get married. In fact, you could even buy a
husband or a wife. However, I believe marriage is
beyond getting married but being happily married.
And trust me, I have been counseling couples for a
while so I can tell you it is better to be happy and
single than to be married and sad. That is why my
emphasis is on how to help you build the marriage of
your dreams; not just to marry anybody or marry at all
cost but to be happily married.
Sometimes when you are in a romantic relationship or
you meet somebody you like, the rate at which the
relationship progresses is so fast that you don't have
time to ask the important questions. It's like driving a
brand new car especially if you've been driving an
old one before. You will discover that when you are driving the old car, there is a level you will hit on the
speedometer that the car begins to jerk. That's a sign
that you are going beyond your limit but when it is a
brand new car that is in good condition, you might be
at a very high speed and not even know it. Driving fast
and not knowing it is dangerous. That's how some
people's relationships are! So these questions are like
your speedometer; to help you know when you are
over speeding or doing things wrongly.
The mistake a lot of people make especially women is
that they think marriage is it, that it is the last bus-stop.
No! Marriage is not an end in itself; it's just a means to
an end: fulfillment! Marriage is a long trip and if you
are not fulfilled, you will be discontented. There is no
middle ground. It's either one or the other. That is
why you must prepare well and ask the right
questions before you hand over your life to that man.
You have to be sure that the man you are giving the
rest of your life to is worth it.
Another thing I noticed is, when the people around
you are not experienced or knowledgeable, they ask
the wrong questions. They ask questions like: Do you
love him? Does he love you? And those things are very vague! Many people don't even know what love
is! So do you love him means do you have butterflies
in your stomach? And she does! You can't hand over
your destiny to some man just because you have
butterflies in your stomach! You must ask the right
questions!
When I say ask questions, I don't mean you should sit
him down and bring out your paper and pen and say
question time. No! That's not what I'm saying. Some of
these questions are things you might need to ask
yourself, some are things you might ask indirectly and
some are things you might need to observe or watch
as the relationship or friendship progresses. Don't
make it so obvious otherwise he will give you a
"good" answer. He will tell you exactly what he knows
you want to hear.

09/05/2024, 23:04 - +263 78 692 6053: ‭John 15:18-19 NIV‬
[18]  “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. [19] If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 


‭James 4:4 NIV‬
[4] You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. 

 We don't belong to the World.

10/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 77 454 8584: ‭Romans 8:28 NIV‬
[28] And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.

But grateful for the little i have😊
10/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 77 454 8584: But we then ask ourselves why things are not working together for good in our lives
10/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 77 454 8584: We ask ourselves why we suffer despite having a purpose or a prophesy that has been said over our lives
10/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 78 849 1118: 😭😭😭no
10/05/2024, 19:33 - +263 77 454 8584: You look at everything you do and you say you love the Lord 
So then why isn't everything working together for good
10/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 77 454 8584: This is because  in most times when we read scripture 
We take the parts we like 
But then we ignore the requirements that comes with certain scriptures

10/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 77 454 8584: For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit  to God's law indeed it cannot

And we please God by denying the things of the flesh and submitting to the things of the spirits

10/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 77 454 8584: Romans 8 Verse 14 for all who are led by the spirit are the children of God
10/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 77 454 8584: Loving God is allowing the spirit to lead you
10/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 77 454 8584: When you are lead by the spirit  
Then that's when you become a child of God
10/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 77 454 8584: You cannot claim to be a child of God and sin all the time
10/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 849 1118: 🫵🏾
10/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 77 454 8584: God is looking for children who are fully committed to the things of the spirit
10/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 77 454 8584: If you are disconnected from the spirit then some verses will not work for you
10/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 77 454 8584: There are so many verse in the bible in which God is promising protection, wisdom, prosperity, security
10/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 77 454 8584: The list is endless
10/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 77 454 8584: We read some of these verses and we think the Lord has forsaken us
10/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 77 454 8584: It's because we do not look at the conditions 
We do not look at the requirements to be called a child of God
10/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 77 454 8584: If you Love the Lord you will follow his words
10/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 77 454 8584: If you love his you will worship him
10/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 77 454 8584: If you love him you will sacrifice for him
10/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see things work together for good in your life
10/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see that truly truly is goodness and mercy follows you all the day of your life
10/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see that if he is for us then who can be against us
10/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see a thousand on your right ten thousand on your left and non coming near you
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to have joy and peace that does not make sence
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: You will start to have joy in chaos
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: Peace in chaos
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: All things really work together for good for the one who loves the Lord
10/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 77 454 8584: Look at the areas of your life where you want God to intervene, and it looks like he is not doing anything
10/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 77 454 8584: Then  look at your lifestyle 
Are you denying the things of the flesh 
Are you resisting the devil
10/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 77 454 8584: Start to follow the things of the spirit and see what the Lord does for his children
10/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 77 454 8584: Show your love for the Lord
10/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 77 454 8584: If you love the Lord you will follow his words and submit your spirit  
Then all things will start to make sense and work together for good in your life
10/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 77 454 8584: Thank you😇

13/05/2024, 17:51 - +263 78 001 7053: My first  enemy  hated me from the day my mom  was pregnant
13/05/2024, 17:54 - +263 78 001 7053: Because  every child  born is a sign of God's  solution to a family
13/05/2024, 17:55 - +263 78 001 7053: The occupation  of Satan can be summarized  to 3 things 

Satan comes to kill 

Steal  

And Destroy
13/05/2024, 17:55 - +263 78 346 1988: I have no idea munhu washe
13/05/2024, 17:56 - +263 78 001 7053: I started  to understand  what  an enemy  was 

When i was only  5 years  old
13/05/2024, 17:57 - +263 78 001 7053: I had just escaped  living  in Mabvuku

And we had moved to a new place
13/05/2024, 17:58 - +263 78 001 7053: But when  I arrived  at the new place  

I was hated  for  a few things
13/05/2024, 18:00 - +263 78 001 7053: One of the major  things  

Is because  I had a beautiful  neighbor 😍😊❤️

About  my age 

And our parents  were close  

So it yielded  to my favor since  I got to spend  more time with the girl
13/05/2024, 18:01 - +263 78 001 7053: This was my first encounter  with beauty ❤️

But this was also my first encounter  with enemies
13/05/2024, 18:02 - +263 78 001 7053: Our first encounters  with beauty  

Usually  come with enemies
13/05/2024, 18:03 - +263 78 001 7053: When David  encountered  the beauty and feeling  of killing  Goliath  

He invited  himself  a bigger  enemy
13/05/2024, 18:04 - +263 78 001 7053: The beautiful  victory  

Brought  him a much  bigger  enemy
13/05/2024, 18:05 - +263 78 001 7053: King Saul 

Was a bigger enemy  than Goliath
13/05/2024, 18:06 - +263 78 001 7053: Today I want  to 

Open up  a series  of 

How to deal with enemies

My mom got a sudden  health attack  as she was driving  to work
13/05/2024, 20:11 - +263 78 001 7053: She left home  okay  but  less than a kilometer away from home she struggled  to breathe
13/05/2024, 20:12 - +263 78 001 7053: She felt  excruciating  pain  

And she was desperate  to be okay to the point  of even believing  that death was a safe passage  to being  okay
13/05/2024, 20:14 - +263 78 001 7053: Afraid  to see her in a desperate  state  I didn't  go home 

I stayed at school  and engaged  in prayers with my friends

13/05/2024, 20:16 - +263 78 001 7053: When I finally  went home  

I got the  privilege  to know  the story  that I am about  to share
13/05/2024, 20:17 - +263 78 001 7053: When someone  is so sick  and close  to death 

They open up and share everything  

So during  those moments  my mom exposed  me to certain  truth
13/05/2024, 20:17 - +263 78 001 7053: That's when I discovered  

That the Lord has always  fought for us

13/05/2024, 20:18 - +263 78 001 7053: That the Lord 

Is Great  is battle
13/05/2024, 20:18 - +263 78 001 7053: He is above our human 

Security
13/05/2024, 20:19 - +263 78 001 7053: He is above  our human  

Intelligence
13/05/2024, 20:20 - +263 78 001 7053: When I was still a little  child  one of my closest  relative 

Put a pillow  over my head and chest and attempted  to suffocate  me to death
13/05/2024, 20:20 - +263 77 468 1594: Amen
13/05/2024, 20:21 - +263 78 001 7053: She put  her whole weight  on me and 

Fortunately  our maid spotted  her  and rescued  me
13/05/2024, 20:21 - +263 77 468 1594: Glory 😤 👏
13/05/2024, 20:21 - +263 71 276 7383: Last year 🥹😭
13/05/2024, 20:22 - +263 78 001 7053: The second  attempt  

Was when she put a table  on top of me and tried to suffocate  me again 

But fortunately  my brother @263775558290 

Was there to my rescue
13/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: The first enemy  

A person encounters in his way to greatness  is a close relative  or family members
13/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 026 5054: Kuee
13/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 77 461 9483: Thank you baby❤️
13/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Before David  reached  out  to Goliath  

His first hindrance  was 

His brothers
13/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 78 258 5433: Yessss✅
Following
13/05/2024, 20:25 - +263 78 001 7053: The book  of 1 Samuel 17 

Gives  us the full account
13/05/2024, 20:26 - +263 78 001 7053: Before  Joseph  encountered  potiphar 

Or the pit 

His brothers  were the first hindrance
13/05/2024, 20:27 - +263 77 119 4399: 🫠
13/05/2024, 20:27 - +263 78 001 7053: The family  can fight  you 

Verbally  

Emotionally  

Spiritually  

Or physically
13/05/2024, 20:28 - +263 78 001 7053: When Jesus  was about to come 

An angel had to fight  for him over family  affairs
13/05/2024, 20:28 - +263 78 814 7058: Ndokutengera mangwana.
You remind me.
13/05/2024, 20:29 - +263 78 001 7053: Because  Joseph  was close to leaving  Mary  

But an angel had to come to reconcile  the family
13/05/2024, 20:30 - +263 78 001 7053: When Moses was about  to be elevated  

Pharoah  wasn't  his first  enemy  

But a close Egyptian  was his namesis
13/05/2024, 20:31 - +263 78 001 7053: We can go to as far 

As 

Cain and Abel  

Jacob and Esau

13/05/2024, 20:32 - +263 78 001 7053: But the Lord  is giving  us 

Power 

Over  family  enemies
13/05/2024, 20:32 - +263 71 633 5894: Am learning
13/05/2024, 20:32 - +263 71 633 5894: Amennnn

13/05/2024, 20:33 - +263 78 001 7053: Yesss you have  been oppressed  

Yess you have  been  undermined 

But it was just a path to your promotion
13/05/2024, 20:35 - +263 78 001 7053: The Second  Enemy  that came was Goliath  


An Enemy  which  is bigger  than family  

But an Enemy  that  fights  your whole  city ,school  ,nation or ghetto  

Depending  on the area  of your calling
13/05/2024, 20:36 - +263 78 001 7053: Goliath  is an Enemy  that affects  your generation
13/05/2024, 20:36 - +263 78 001 7053: Enemies  like drug abuse
13/05/2024, 20:37 - +263 78 001 7053: Enemies  like pornography 

Enemies  Like  Ama blesser

Enemies  like alcoholism
13/05/2024, 20:37 - +263 78 258 5433: Amen
13/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: In growing  in the Lord 

You go beyond  fighting  family  battles
13/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: And you start fighting  

Corruption
13/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: You start fighting

13/05/2024, 20:58 - +263 78 001 7053: David  fought  with Goliath  different  from the way he fought  with  Saul
13/05/2024, 20:59 - +263 78 001 7053: He allowed  God to fight  for him 

Meaning  he didn't  use a sword  

A sling  

Or tarnished  the image  of Saul
13/05/2024, 20:59 - +263 78 026 5054: Oh yess🔥, strategy
13/05/2024, 21:00 - +263 78 001 7053: When you fight someone  who taught you things 

Someone  who  inspired  you 

Someone  who was once used by God 

You allow  God to perform  the fight
13/05/2024, 21:01 - +263 78 001 7053: Don't  fight your teachers 

Don't  fight  your pastors 


Allow  God to fight for you
13/05/2024, 21:02 - +263 78 001 7053: In closing  I say 

The Quality  of your enemies  determines  

The magnitude  of your strength

Because  God was calling  him to the Level of Starting a big Church
13/05/2024, 21:07 - +263 78 001 7053: When you see a local  preacher being  attacked  by international  preachers

Fear the magnitude  of your enemies
13/05/2024, 21:12 - +263 78 001 7053: A lion will never fight an ant
13/05/2024, 21:12 - +263 78 001 7053: A president  will never  waste energy  fighting  a toddler
13/05/2024, 21:12 - +263 78 001 7053: You are big 


You are Enormous
13/05/2024, 21:13 - +263 78 001 7053: When your enemies  come in like a flood  

The Lord  will raise  a standard
13/05/2024, 21:13 - +263 78 001 7053: When enemies  throw weapons  

No weapon fashioned  against  you will prosper
13/05/2024, 21:14 - +263 78 346 1988: I am big

13/05/2024, 21:14 - +263 78 001 7053: When you seem to be defeated  

When you seem to be down and dead

Just like  Paul  who they thought  he was dead after they stoned him

14/05/2024, 08:04 - +263 78 001 7053: Ecclesiastes 11 vs 5


As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.
14/05/2024, 08:05 - +263 78 001 7053: 11 vs 6 


Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.

14/05/2024, 08:15 - +263 78 001 7053: Ecclesiastes 11 vs 8


However many years a man may live, let him enjoy them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.
14/05/2024, 08:15 - +263 78 001 7053: 11 vs 9 


Be happy, young man, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
14/05/2024, 08:16 - +263 78 001 7053: 11 vs 10


So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.

14/05/2024, 10:35 - +263 78 488 1340: I think it depends with what was your relationship like. Remember you don't just get into a relationship with someone for the fun of things it's actually with marriage as an end result so you end up investing yourself emotionally. So, when someone end up leaving it drains you and that's whats painful, that's where the heartbreak part comes in. I don't know if that is making sense <This message was edited>
14/05/2024, 10:38 - +263 78 814 7058: Yes, it is making sense.
I was looking at the magnitude.
Your investment pasomeone you married is different pane someone you are in a courtship with.

Magnitude of course it's different but also remember that every individual has uhh what do l say level of pain tolerance that is different 😅 l guess it varies with individuals.

On the ingredients  

Instruments

19/03/2024, 08:45 - Bothaz: If you can come up with a new concept/idea we will be grateful,  however coming up with new concepts require deep research. Research is all about improving what exists. They is no problem that has never been solved .All the  problems that you want to solve at your workplace has been solved. Now solutions are becoming smarter because of the technologies we now have including cloud, Big data, AI , IOT etc. We now want solutions that are 🧠 smarter. Yes improve what has been done. Some of your companies doesn't have basic solutions, etc  a website and they use a lot of paperwork .We don't want basic solutions,  that has been  done in other countries 20 years back.Come up with a system that can compete in  India,  southafrica,  America etc
19/03/2024, 08:45 - Bothaz: Give us a historical perspective 

Remember this problem did not start to exist today.It has existed for years now and all these years various researchers have attempted to solve the problem and they have solved the problem. The problem has been solved in different ways. 

Manual
Excel sheet 
Information management systems 
Intelligent info systems(Utilizing AI)

Problems has been always there but what changes is how the problems need to be solved 

Eg  communication
Problem: people need to communicate 

We have seen how researchers have solved the communication problem over the years. With the advent of new technologies. The way communication is being done is changing 

Early years- traditional methods of communicating etc using smoke , drums etc


Early 90's- emails
Early 200 - rise of telecommunications and mobile phones changed how people communicate (phone calls , sms)

Smartphones - these gave birth to social media platforms 

2020- social media platforms continue to be improved,  Facebook,  Twitter etc.AI is being infused in every aspect 

The way we communicate keeps on changing. The way we solve the communication problem keeps on charging.

The question you must ask yourself is how is your companies  problem being solved now. Be guided by the literature.Review the literature. Manual to digital is not what we want .You can always solve your company needs using the most current sophisticated techniques 

Come up with a product that can be exported  to Europe!!!

NSSA Mail
​
Dear Colleagues,


Please be advised that Harare Gardens has become criminally ridden of late as there are two puzzling murder cases recorded that occurred in broad daylight recently where armed robbers stabbed two victims on separate occasions using sharp objects to subdue victims into submission to hand over their valuables such as phones and handbags. This is indeed scary taking into account that we are juxtaposed with Harare Gardens, and we urge NSSA staff and surrounding neighbours to immediately desist from using Harare Gardens as a thoroughfare to either access passport offices or other related places close to Harare Gardens. Please take heed, life is precious and don’t be a statistic. 

 

Kind regards,

28/03/2024, 14:13 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: *Zimbabwean Family Of Six Now Requires $5.4 Million Per Month*

*Follow Pindula on WhatsApp for daily new updates*
https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va84dngJP21B2nWeyM3v?ws


According to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT), an average family of six now needs a minimum of ZWL$5.4 million to cover their monthly expenses. This represents a 65.8% increase compared to the figures recorded last month.

ZIMSTAT also revealed that the Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL) for one person was ZW$ 916,225.50 in March 2024. Said ZIMSTAT:

> This means that an individual required that much to purchase both non-food and food items as of March 2024 in order not to be deemed poor.

> This represents an increase of 65.8 per cent when compared to the February 2024 figure of ZWL$552,745.80.


The Food Poverty Line (FPL) for one person in March 2024 was ZWL$701,236.89. This means that the minimum needs basket cost that much per person in March 2024. This represents an increase of 62.2 per cent over the February 2024 figure of ZWL$432,454.90.

The Zimbabwe dollar has plummeted over the past few weeks which economic commentators have blamed on the excessive printing of money by the central bank that is not backed by value.

On Friday, March 22, the Zimbabwean dollar crossed a notable threshold, falling below 20,000 against the US dollar. This decline occurred after it had previously dropped below the 10,000 level in late January.

The local currency was trading at 20,389 per greenback, indicating a cumulative decline of 70% since the beginning of the year.

Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube, recently Zimbabwe will always have a local currency even though currently, the US dollar is used for 80% of all commerce in the country.

Ncube said the monetary policy statement (MPS), which is overdue by two months, will be released soon, adding that there are ongoing consultations with experts within the government and other stakeholders.

https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va84dngJP21B2nWeyM3v?di

THE Government is finalising new regulations to set up a State-controlled third-party motor vehicle insurance scheme that will assume the responsibility of underwriting compulsory vehicle liability insurance, currently handled by private insurers.

The regulations, set to be unveiled next month, will see private insurers relinquishing their role in underwriting third-party motor vehicle insurance, which is compulsory in terms of the Road Traffic Act.

Presently, it covers death, injury and damage to property in road traffic accidents.

The authorities believe the coverage offered by private insurers is insufficient and often leaves policyholders with additional expenses, especially when claims are made after accidents.

Conversely, the State-backed scheme is envisaged to offer a broader range of benefits, including covering medical expenses incurred following accidents; financial compensation for injuries sustained in accidents; funeral grants in the event of an accident-related death and compensation for lost income due to injuries.

Top lawyer Fadzayi Mahere has raised concerns over the Government’s plans to introduce a “structured currency.”

She argues that the lack of public education and the absence of a legal framework pose significant challenges to its implementation.

----------

In February, President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced that the Government was actively working on a structured currency as part of their efforts to enhance currency and economic stability.

Reports indicate that the launch of this structured currency is imminent, coinciding with the appointment of John Mushayavanhu as the new Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor.

Fadzayi Mahere, sharing her thoughts on social media, advises the public to exercise caution. She points out that previous currency introductions in recent years have all faced challenges and ultimately failed. She said:


> Rule number one, if they mention anything to do with “1:1 gedye”, know we are heading for disaster. Last time they said that we ended up at 1:42000.

> Rule number two, if they mention anything to do with “gold backing”, know it’s a scam. What happened to the gold-backed Ziggy jiggy? Did it stabilise the economy?

> Rule number three, no legal framework, no legal tender. You don’t “launch” a currency like you’re launching a music album.

> It is called “legal tender” for a reason. It must have the force of law. You can’t roll out something as important as money without a legal statute.

> Rule number four, why the ambush? Why not give people notice of what you’re trying to do so you calm suspicion?

> They have a knack for taking an economic idea and mangling it so it implodes – look no further than the forex auction that wasn’t an auction.

> How many times do we need to learn the lesson that command economics does not work?

Bulawayo Mayor David Coltart also warned that the proposed “structured currency” will face challenges unless the institutions overseeing its introduction and management regain public trust. He said:

> I have noted statements made recently that the current government intends to introduce a new currency this week with some alarm.

> The solution to hyperinflation and a weakening currency does not lie in replacing it with a new currency.

> The reason our present currency has performed so badly is that people DO NOT TRUST the institution responsible for regulating it.

> The most important criterion in the running of any central bank is TRUST. Until TRUST is restored this new currency is doomed to fail as well.

> TRUST is only created when those running the central bank are recognized professionals who have been appointed because of their integrity and demonstrable skills, not who they know.

> TRUST is only created when there is total transparency and the central bank is demonstrably being run for the benefit of all, not just a small ruling clique.


In recent years, the Goverment has introduced several currencies that include Bearer Cheques, Traveller’s Cheques, Agro-Cheques, Bond Coins, Bond Notes, RTGS, Zim Dollars, Nostro, Gold Token and ZiG.

Hanzi pane varikuita basa rekuti when you’re trying to reverse from your parking, they move near your car then scream and say you’ve run over their foot. Usually vanenge vakamira ne ‘shamwari’ dzavo and they will all start loudly accusing you to attract a crowd, apawo uyu ‘wekutsikwa’ achizhamba making a scene, and you know people havatani kuungana and start taking videos etc. Then the ‘victim’ will say something like ndiendesei ku Avenues (knowing it’s expensive) ozoti horaiti chindipai USD100 or something similar. So please be careful. Even ma streetkids are doing this.

07/04/2024, 15:14 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: ZiG USD online currency exchange calculator launched

----------
RBZ recent introduction of the new currency, ZiG, alongside the existing USD and ZWL (bond note & RTGS), has ushered in a period of calculation complications. With three official currencies now in circulation, navigating through exchange rates and conversions has become difficult. 
However, an online currency exchange calculator has been launched today, designed to simplify the conversion process for the primary currencies used in Zimbabwe.

This online tool, provided by TechNews Zimbabwe, offers users the convenience of effortless conversions between USD, ZiG, and ZWL, helping them adapt to the changing financial landscape with ease. Try out the calculator at https://zig.technews.co.zw

Although President Emmerson Mnangagwa has warned security personnel against taking part in criminal activities and vowed to use ruthless means to deal with them, reports indicate otherwise. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi on Friday appealed to members of the public to expose the uniformed forces involved in criminal activities. “Some robberies are linked to members of the security services in the country,” Nyathi told Southern Eye in an interview on Friday – Southern Eye, Monday April 8, Pg 6

10/04/2024, 07:57 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: ‘ZiG difficult to accept in US$-dominated market: Respected businessman and economist Nigel Chanakira says acceptance of the new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), will be difficult given that the majority still prefer the greenback. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) launched ZiG and scrapped the Zimdollar last week after the latter had significantly depreciated over the past few months. In the first quarter of the year alone, the Zimdollar depreciated by slightly more than 260%. Chanakira made the remarks at a post-2024 Monetary Policy and Outlook Conference yesterday which was hosted by NewsDay’s sister paper Zimbabwe Independent. Chanakira asked the conference attendees who were close to 200 to show by raising of hands, which currency they preferred between the US dollar and ZiG and all chose the former – NewsDay, Wednesday April 10, Pg 1

11/04/2024, 07:51 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Traders begin accepting ZiG currency: Some traders have started accepting ZiG currency after banks successfully configured their digital platforms and the shops reset their prices in the new currency. Other traders are now at an advanced stage to migrate to the use of the new local currency before tomorrow’s deadline. Mainstream large retailers were transacting in both ZiG and foreign currency by allowing those with bank cards to swipe after the banks completed configuring their systems so the cards would work. According to a market update by Zimswitch, which has already completed the roll out of the ZiG processing system, about 15 banks were live with the ZiG by yesterday. These included NMB Bank Limited, POSB, InnBucks, Empowerment Bank, Stanbic Bank, ZB Financial Holdings, Nedbank, CABS, First Capital Bank, Ecobank, One Money, O’mari, My Cash, African Century, EcoCash and Steward Bank, with the few remaining indicating that they would follow suit and beat tomorrow’s deadline. Zimswitch is the country’s sole national payments platform and clearing house. It was incorporated in 1994 to process domestic card-based, both ATM and point of sale “swipe”, and EFT transactions among member financial institutions in real-time online. EcoCash Holdings, the largest local mobile money platform, notified its customers yesterday that it had successfully converted Zimbabwean dollars to ZiG currency although there were delays in letting people spend their ZiG balances on EcoCash products.
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mushayavanhu last week introduced the new currency which is backed by the country’s gold and foreign currency reserves issued – Herald, Thursday April 11, Pg 2

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has urged traders, including commuter omnibuses, shops, fresh vegetable markets, and vendors, to continue accepting Zimbabwe dollar notes until April 30, 2024.

The majority of service providers and shops no longer accept Zim dollar notes, leading to a “change crisis.” As a result, prices are now being rounded off to US$1, making goods and services more expensive.

In a statement issued this Wednesday by the Central Bank, Governor John Mushayavanhu reiterated that the Zim dollar remains legal tender. Reads the statement:


> ZIMBABWE DOLLAR NOTES CO-CIRCULATING WITH ZiG AND OTHER CURRENCIES

> Further to the Reserve Bank’s Press Statement of 6 April 2024 on currency conversion from ZW$ to ZiG, the banking sector and payment service providers have made significant and satisfactory progress, in this regard.

> Commendably, over 90% of the banking institutions and mobile bank service providers have successfully configured their systems and processes from ZW$ to ZiG, with banking services now being accessible for the convenience of the transacting public.

> The Reserve Bank is also encouraged by the positive response and enthusiasm from the business community and the public at large to embrace and use ZiG.

> The Reserve Bank has, however, taken note of the concerns of the public emanating from the rejection of the ZW$ notes to be demonetised, which has resulted in the unavailability of “change”, thus forcing businesses, mainly commuter omnibuses to round off prices to US$1.

> In this context, the Reserve Bank would like to reiterate that the ZW$ notes currently in circulation are still valid and remain legal tender until 30 April 2024.

> Accordingly, the ZW$ notes should continue to be used for transactional purposes at the announced ZiG/ZW$ conversion factor of 2498.7242.

> Business entities where the notes have been widely used, including commuter omnibuses, shops, fresh vegetable markets, and vendors, are advised to continue accepting payment in ZW$ notes until 30 April 2024.

> For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank advises the public and businesses that the Know Your Customer (KYC) transaction limit of ZW$100,000 does not apply to proceeds from legitimate business transactions during the transition period to 30 April 2024.

> The Reserve Bank wishes to advise the public that the educational and awareness campaign on the transition from the ZW$ to the use of ZiG in the market is currently underway and expected to be all-inclusive, reaching out to a wider spectrum of society by the 30th of April 2024, in line with the Bank’s financial inclusion strategy.

​
Dear Colleagues,


Please be advised that Harare Gardens has become criminally ridden of late as there are two puzzling murder cases recorded that occurred in broad daylight recently where armed robbers stabbed two victims on separate occasions using sharp objects to subdue victims into submission to hand over their valuables such as phones and handbags. This is indeed scary taking into account that we are juxtaposed with Harare Gardens, and we urge NSSA staff and surrounding neighbours to immediately desist from using Harare Gardens as a thoroughfare to either access passport offices or other related places close to Harare Gardens. Please take heed, life is precious and don’t be a statistic. 

 

Kind regards,

Starlink is shutting down its services in Zimbabwe. Technology publication, Techzim, has reported that people using Starlink received an email today telling them the Zimbabwean  government has demanded that the service be shut down.

Here’s a screenshot of the email they received from Starlink:

> You are currently using Starlink in an unauthorised territory, As a result. Starlink has been directed by the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) to disable your service.

✅ *Follow Pindula on WhatsApp for daily new updates*
https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va84dngJP21B2nWeyM3v?oe

> We will continue to work with POTRAZ to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to turn on Starlink services in Zimbabwe as soon as possible. We encourage you to contact POTRAZ at the.regulator@potraz.gov.zw or +263 242 333032 to communicate your support for Starlink to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in Zimbabwe.

> As described In your Terms of Service, Starlink does not guarantee when or where its Mobile or Mobile Priority Services Plans will be available. Use of such services Is dependent on many factors, including obtaining or maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals which are subject to change.

> You may pause service and billing by following the Instructions here or continue service and use your Starlink service in an area we currently serve (see map here), If you opt to pause service, you can reach out to support and we will issue a service credit for any remainder of the current billing period.

According to the Techzim report, Starlink has about an estimated 5,000 users of the service in the country.

In February, the telecoms regulator in Zimbabwe POTRAZ, said that while Starlink had expressed interest in getting a license to  operate in Zimbabwe, it had actually not applied for one. Users of the service were therefore essentially breaking the law.

Last month, reports suggested that government was holding meetings with officials from Starlink over licensing of the service in Zimbabwe.

Pindula spoke to one user familiar with the situation who commented on how such a shut down works:

> So what this means is that Starlink are not able to offer service to their customers in Zimbabwe.

> If someome who has a Starlink kit travels to Zimbabwe, Starlink are not in a position to offer service.

> If the user goes somewhere else, like any of the countries they’re registered in (Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Eswatini, Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya, etc) or any other country that they’re not banned in (Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Angola, etc) then the device will work

Zimbabwean users are not the first to receive such a notice from Starlink. Reports last month suggest users in DRC also had their Starlink terminals shut down in similar circumstances.

Starlink offers the cheapest means to communicate to the internet in Zimbabwe. At roughly $38 a month, its users get unlimited access to the internet.

 *[🌕] Seke Road Armed Robber Used Stolen Identity For 25 Years* 

FOLLOW THIS CHANNEL ✅

An armed robber who recently admitted to 35 counts of armed robbery committed along Seke Road had been using stolen identity for the past 25 years.

According to The Sunday Mail, the notorious criminal, Norman Sithole was arrested after robbing a motorist of US$250 and a cellphone.

Sithole only confessed moments before he was sentenced by magistrate Batanai Madzingira that the name appearing on the State papers was not his.


He had been using Anceloti Musengi’s national identity card for two and a half decades.

Musengi lost his ID in April 1998 at the Mbare Musika bus terminus while travelling to his rural home in Chirumhanzu, Midlands Province, for the Easter holidays.

Musengi, then aged 23, lost his wallet, which contained his national identity card, bank and medical aid cards, as well as cash as he jostled with other travellers to get a seat on a “Chicken Bus” to Midlands.

He only got to replace his ID card when he returned to Harare.

Musengi, who is employed by a renowned local financial institution, was to recover his original national identity card a fortnight ago after Sithole’s confession at the Mbare Magistrates’ Court.

Sithole did not state how he obtained Musengi’s ID card but confirmed that he got the identification particulars at Mbare Musika in 1998.

This led prosecutor Janet Mlambo to institute further investigations, which established that the convict was indeed telling the truth.

Sithole was subsequently slapped with a 40-year jail term. However, the court suspended three years and nine months on condition of good behaviour.

Another five years and five months were suspended on condition that Sithole pay back all the people he had robbed.

This means Sithole may serve a prison term of 30 years and 10 months.

Sithole’s reign of terror along Seke Road ended recently when he was arrested in Harare after robbing a local mechanic, Maurice Musiiwa, of US$250 and a cellphone.

On the day of the robbery, at around 8 PM, Musiiwa was driving a Mercedes-Benz C240 from Harare’s city centre to Chitungwiza along Seke Road.

As he slowed down to negotiate a pothole near the Delport turn-off, Sithole’s alleged accomplice, Walter Mapfumo, pretended to stumble and fall in front of his car, forcing him to stop.

Musiiwa disembarked from the car to find out what was happening and Mapfumo jumped to his feet and used a knife to force him to surrender all his belongings.

Sithole and Mapfumo then robbed Musiiwa of an Itel cellphone and a wallet with US$250.

Police investigations led to the recovery of an Itel S23, which had been sold to Mavis Nyambala, who later led police to Sithole.

Sithole then implicated Mapfumo as his accomplice. Mapfumo denied the charges, and is on remand awaiting trial.

The conversion from ZWL to ZiG as it relates to the local currency refers. Please be advised that the
process of converting Staff Loans from ZWL to ZiG is still underway.

In light of this, staff are advised to ensure that their accounts are adequately funded to meet the April
2024 loan repayments which will be debited once the conversion has been finalised. It is projected
that this process will be completed by end of day 17 April 2024.

Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor Gideon Gono has responded to allegations raised by ZANU PF national spokesman, Chris Mutsvangwa, that a former central bank governor facilitated the “theft” of the country’s gold by Arabs.


During a press briefing in Harare on Monday, Mutsvangwa claimed that Zimbabwe’s gold reserves were taken out of the country during the tenure of the late President Robert Mugabe, and the RBZ Governor at the time, who he did not name, sought assistance from contacts in the Arab world, who said they could provide US dollars.

----------

Mutsvangwa added that an agreement was proposed wherein US dollars would be exchanged for Zimbabwe’s gold reserves.

Under the deal, Zimbabwe’s gold was to be transported from the RBZ’s vaults to a location abroad, allowing the Arab partners to verify the reserves.

Mutsvangwa said while the gold was transferred as per the agreement, the country never received the US dollars as per the agreement.

Gono refuted Mutsvangwa’s assertions, labelling them as “lies.” He explained that Mutsvangwa was Zimbabwe’s Ambassador to China, and he was misinformed about what really happened during the country’s financial crisis.

Below is Gono’s response to the allegations:


> “SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT: NO “GOLD RESERVES” WERE EVER STOLEN BY ANYONE DURING MY TENURE AS RBZ GOVERNOR UNDER FMR. Late President Robert Gabriel Mugabe’s WATCH.

> 1. Recent pronouncements by Hon. Chris Mutsvangwa, falsely alleging that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) lost an unspecified quantity of gold to an unnamed Arab country during the tenure of an “unnamed Governor”who”served under the late Former President R.G.Mugabe ( MHDSRIEP)put the Nation in a state of unnecessary frenzy . If such lies are left unchecked with authentic facts, they could become that “little spark” that sets alight a whole forest at a time when the Bank ( RBZ) and the country at large, have more important issues to deal with than waste time attending to veld-fires whose uncontrolled consequences could end up melting whatever confidence the Bank is trying to build around itself, the country and this great Nation at large… and how dare we dampen people’s spirits at this “ celebratory hour” with blatant lies!

> 2. Ordinarily, past Governors are not supposed to comment publicly on matters “current”which a sitting Governor is capable of dealing with regardless of which period those matters occurred. However in this case, I feel the need for leadership in dealing with this matter, so that there is we do not burden our new Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu or immediate past Governor Dr John Mangudya ,with an historical matter that I can easily deal with myself without “ambiguities “or the need to look for “sekuru Ndunge”( the late doyen of traditional healing and forecasting”to return from the other world so he can provide spiritual proclamations to something that is so straightforward, simple ( if we respect TRUTH)and explainable in plain, non-technical English.

> 3.If this explanation still proves difficult to understand, I would advocate that we ask His Excellency President E.D. Mnangagwa to set in a Commission of Inquiry in terms of the Commission of Inquiry Act( Chapter 10:07)incorporating all interested parties to look into this serious allegation of perfidious proportions and report to the Nation its Findings in simpler language than i would have done here.

> 4. Ordinarily too, no Governor would want to comment publicly on any matters he/ she dealt with while in Office because The Official Secrets Act( Chapter 11:09) by which binds and prohibits us from commenting on specific documentation recieved or matters of the State dealt with during our periods in Office(Section 4 is particularly telling ( level 14 fine or 20 years in jail or both if violated) but I am risking that by putting the record straight in a manner that cleans the image of the Nation’s Central Bank.

> 5. The third reason I have decided to take the bull by the horns is the ambiguous nature of the allegations, casting aspersions on many distinguished personalities who served as Governors under Former President RGM and still carry “scars and pride” of national service equal only to a few living souls around during one of the most difficult economic episodes of our country.

> 6. Their (Ex Governors) integrities ought to be respected and protected in retirement, as well as those the Hon. Ministers of Finance under whom they served and reported to. It is my duty to set the record straight for their sake as well as mine, so that our new Governor does not take his eyes off the “ZiG ball” to go into the archives of 18 years ago, searching for files and records for a response to this little fire that has deliberately or inadvertently been started with checking facts with all concerned.

> 7. For the record ,former Governors for the period concerned which excludes our inaugural independence Governor the late Dr K. Moyana( MHDSRIEP) ( 1983-93)are: Dr L. L. Tsumba( 1993-2003)part of the sanctions period 2001 to May 2003);Acting Governor Charles Chikaura( May 2003-November 2003);Acting Governor Dr Charity Dhliwayo ( December 2013-April,2014); Dr John Mangudya (May,2014-November 2017).These periods were under Late Fmr. President RGM. I am sure all of them have suffered some distress because the statement from the Hon. Ambassador Spokesperson was ambiguous as to who among us could have been that dump or daft! Now they can all sit back and tell their families and friends “ no it was not me whom was being referred to”!

> 8. I proudly served the longest of that sanctions period, 10 years in all, giving my country the best I could, from 1December 2003 to 30 November,2013 and it is natural to guess then who did what and when.

> UPFRONT…
9. Upfront, in summary, let it be known by all that we are talking here of whatCOULD , if it had succeeded, have been a “structured gold-backed transaction “which required mining the gold from underground in the first place, then export it in exchange for funds that would have been delivered and repackaged “fourfold in the first place” involving international banks and all above board, but after the first transaction amounting to US$5m deposit was executed by RBZ, the transaction failed on the other side and all parties to the envisaged transaction reimbursed each other, with no prejudice incurred or suffered by any of the parties to the transaction and ultimately, no GOLD was mined from underground for further export in terms of the initial Agreement which is now causing a hullabaloo due people who were not part of the RBZ team trying to confuse the Nation instead of letting us is happily celebrate our 44th UHURU!One frowns at the timing of the release of such “ news” even if , by any stretch of imagination, it was true!We need a little bit of finesse and circumspection in the discharge of our duties when it comes to the dissemination that has potential to harm the reputations of others in our positions as leaders! Please.

> 10.That’s the summary but here are the details. Background… ————————-

> 11. Managing this economy during the period 2000 to 2017 was not a “ walk in the park” for any Governor. The full story is yet to be written about the trials and tribulations of the times but that is for another day.

> 12.Some of us got onto the Sanctions list in 2001 and so for 23 years we were not as free Zimbabweans as some amongst us. Again for another day. We will always come out of retirement and defend the country when someone tries to burn it by setting the record straight when necessary.

> 13. The country survived through a series of non conventional gymnastics at a time when it was easier to give up than to accept thankless national service with all its risks in an environment of severe sanctions, international isolation, mono-currency and politically driven hyperinflation. It was a period most people witnessed the futility of trying to turn around our economic fortunes in an environment of needless political confrontation and conflict among fellow citizens.Again, that’s for another day. The RBZ Gold Contract of 2006.

> 14. When making public statements from positions of authority, we must resist temptation to be excitable and ambiguous, particularly when dealing with matters that could harm the confidence of key institutions such as a Central Bank. Facts and full facts backed by understanding the technical side of the matters at hand as well as CONTEXT are important.

> 15. Faced with a “ no forex reserve” situation for both Government and industry, it was incumbent on the sitting Governor to find that forex by whatever legal means and be accountable for every move taken by the Central Bank and its officials. It was also important to keep the Principals, especially the President fully in the picture and to ensure that at the end of each year, the Bank’s books were audited by at least two of the big 5 external international audit firms and results submitted on time to the Minister of Finance and Parliament.

> 16. The RBZ, during my tenure, was at different times annually audited by Delloite & Touché, KPMG, Ernest & Young as well as by Kudenga & Co BDO. At no time during my ten years at the Bank did we get qualified accounts.

> 17. In May,2006 RBZ, after getting express approval from H.E. Cde. RGMugabe, entered into an Agreement with a large Jewelry Company based in Saudi Arabia.

> 18. The contract sought to provide Zimbabwe with an immediate cash injection of US$150m.At the same time, we negotiated with a large South African Bank to deposit that money with them as cash security in exchange for a Guarantee Line of Credit 4 times that amount i.e. US$600m which was to be used for importation of goods and services from South Africa particularly electricity, fuel, grain, fertilizers, mining inputs, machinery etc. in a 3 month revolving basis for 12-24 months as long as the cash backing was there.

> 19.The Guarantee was to cost us 1-2% negotiable at time of execution while the Saudi deal required us to supply over the same period a total of 200,000 Troy ounces of gold at a discount of 34% London Bullion price on day of trading/delivery.

> 20. The discount was on paper very steep but overally when we worked out the sums against the imminent risks that were facing us, we saw ultimate benefit to this economy through the multiplier effect of running the $600m facility on a 3 months cycle for 24 months against gold which was still UNDERGROUND worth between $140-150m to be supplied over a 24 month period while the economy got $600m for immediate use 8 times at a cost of day 1,5%per annum fees. Here is the arithmetic: ——

> 21. It is over ten years since I left RBZ but I still have the conceptual framework in my mind of what was going to happen if it had worked and I am still an Accountant and banker at heart: 200,000 Troy Ounces value $150m ———— Cost( Discount)34% 51m Guarantee Fees to SA Bank 18m ———— Total Facility cost over 2yrs $69m ———— Income Side: ——————- Raising Fees charged to Zim Customers per quarter: 0,0075x$600 x 8 =. $36m Interest @ 5% /quarter. $60m Interest on int. & Fees 7m ————- Total Income to the Bank $103m Less cost of Facility. (69m) ————— Net Income to RBZ. $34m —————- Equivalent to a gain of 50,000 Troy ounces of gold in the 2 years the facility was planned to run for.

> 22. That amount would have been more than sufficient for the Bank’s iwn operating expenses without the need to knock on Treasury for support from tax-payers funds!

> 23. The Bank was required to pay $5m worth of Gold as a deposit and this was paid. When the lender couldn’t deliver the cash backing per contract, the Agreement was canceled and RBZ got back its US$5m.No prejudice to anyone.

> 24. It is important to also realize that we were dealing with an internationally recognized Jeweler and the Saudis are generally very honest people. And to say “ our gold reserves was stolen “ is wrong. We despatched about 7500 or so Troy Ounces worth $5m. We got back our $5m. At that time, in May, gold price was about $700/oz.if I’m not mistaken. Some Basics.

> 25. What is the meaning of Gold Reserves?

> 26.The term RESERVES generally refers to any surplus to immediate requirements.

> 27. Gold Reserves in this case would mean that RBZ had accumulated at some stage, surpluses to its immediate needs but nothing could be further from the truth… I got into a car that had no fuel on 1 December 2003 and I did my best to drive it on empty.

> 28. The Saudi contract was going to be fulfilled over a 12-24 months from incremental gold coming from the ground. We had done our homework as far as who the off-takers of the facility were going to be. It was not a blind shot so to speak.

> 29. To then mislead the public by saying RBZ lost the Nation’s “ Gold Reserves” is surely technically wrong and dangerous, worse when we seek to badmouth and besmirch the dead. Inga zvinonzi “ wafa Wa aka” wani? Why this penchant towards hate-speech against those you were with in the bush but never against Ian Smith? Nobody has bothered to find out how the RBZ was being run during the 15 years of sanctions and what some of us found in whatever records remained in there.

> 30. I certainly am not a direct descendant of St Peter or any of the Apostles who probably did not make mistakes but whatever mistakes my Team and I made during my tenure were neither deliberate nor fraudulent as all the audited set of books during my time there can attest. The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission( ZACC).

> 31. It is this same kind of irresponsible talk we witnessed from Hon. Ambassador Chris Mutsvanga who also happens to be my uncle, which in September/October 2021 led to ZACC spending public money and hours on a wild-goose chase after an anonymous someone misled ZACC to think the same way Zimbabweans have been emotionally whipped to think likewise.

> 32. ZACC carried out extensive investigations into this matter under Ref. 58/12/20 and 102/11/20 examining documents and interviewing RBZ Governor Mangudya, Mr Azvinandaa Saburi ( Director of Financial Markets who signed the Contract with Saudis under my authority) and others including myself in September 2021 and concluded that everything was above board and that there was no prejudice to anyone including RBZ and the Nation at large. Need to verify full facts .

> 33. It is key and important for people entrusted to speak on behalf of important organizations and political parties to always check their facts thoroughly for the sake of their own credibilities and that of others.

> 34. I forgive my sekuru for he was misled into believing that something was really amiss and more importantly, he was in the People’s Republic China as our Ambassador at the time we were battling to sort this economy out so he wouldn’t have been aware of some of the difficulties we went through to try and raise funding, including that required to support our esteemed embassies.

> 35. This country could benefit more from our individual and combined efforts if we sincerely direct them towards what our President, H.E. E.D. Mnangagwa and the Second Republic are trying very hard under difficult circumstances to achieve than to engage in blame-games that will not strengthen our new currency or take us foward especially during the country’s period of UHURU brought about by my sekuru and others.

> 36. Happy 44th to us All. I cherish the wonderful work being done by the Second Republic and salute all our National Heroes and Heroines, gallant fighters of our Liberation War, Mujibhas and Chimbwidos.

> 37. Be advised ALL, that no gold was lost during my time as Governor.

> Dr Gideon Gono.

> RBZ Governor During Biting Sanctions: (2003-13).

> 17 April, 2024.

the global satellite internet provider, Starlink, which is owned by American tycoon, Elon Musk, has applied to operate in
the country. Potraz director-general Gift Machengete revealed this in Bulawayo on Tuesday during a question-and-answer
session at a business function organised by the Ministry of Information Communication Technology (ICTs), Postal and
Courier Services on the sidelines of the ongoing 64th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). Starlink has
become a topic of concern in the country’s ICT sector, with questions being raised on how it operates given its continued
consumer growth and popularity worldwide. Responding to the issue, Machengete said the regulator was seized with the

answer is Starlink had not applied and we would be foolish to then go and say come and apply, please. “Now they have
come to apply and we are in the process of looking at their application,” said Machengete – Herald, Thursday April 25, Pg

The Government has raised the monthly tax-free income tax threshold to about Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG)1 356.


This comes after the Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL), which was replaced by ZiG this month, had depreciated sharply during the first quarter of the year.

----------

As reported by NewsDay, the depreciation meant that the monthly tax-free income tax threshold, at ZWL750 000, translated to US$28,39 at the end of the quarter, way below the cost of living.

This drop was from the US dollar/Zim dollar equivalent of nearly US$74, at the end of January 2024, when the tax-free income tax threshold of ZWL750 000 came into effect.

On Friday, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube, issued Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 74 of 2024, stating that the monthly tax-free income tax threshold is ZiG1 356, about US$100.

This figure was calculated from the figure of ZiG12 204 as stated in the SI covering the period April 5 2024 to December 31 2024.

The S.I. says those earning between ZiG12 204,01 to ZiG36 612, over the same period, would attract a 20% income tax.

Those earning between ZiG36 612,01 to ZiG122 040 will attract a 25% income tax, ZiG122 040,01 to ZiG244 080 (30%), ZiG244 080,01 to ZiG366 120 (35%), and ZiG366 120,01 and above (40%).

In monthly terms, this translates to between ZiG1 356,01 to ZiG4 068 for the 20% income tax, ZiG4 068,01 to ZiG13 650 (25%), ZiG13 650,01 to ZiG27 120 (30%), ZiG27 120,01 to ZiG40 680 (35%), and ZiG40 680,01 and above (40%).

29/04/2024, 07:46 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Executive Power Couple: Why CEOs and CFOs Rule the Boardroom

In Zimbabwe and the rest of the world, the people who rule the boardroom are the CEO and CFO. Power is currency, and the boardroom is its trading floor.  It's no surprise that the two executives who wield the most financial clout, the CEO and CFO, are often the only ones from the executive team to sit on the board. Why? Because, let's face it, businesses are all about making money, and everything else matters less.

The CEO, the company's chief visionary and strategist, is the ultimate decision-maker responsible for steering the ship towards financial glory. And the CFO, the master of the financial universe, is the keeper of the keys, ensuring that every penny is accounted for and every investment turns a profit.

Together, this dynamic duo forms an unstoppable force, orchestrating the company's financial symphony. They are the yin and yang of corporate success, the brains and the brawn, the dreamers and the doers.

So, while other executives may bring their expertise to the table, it's the CEO and CFO who truly hold the reins of power. And in the end, power is what matters most in the business game.

This is precisely why CFOs often get a headstart in the CEO role.

01/05/2024, 14:30 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: *Compulsory Car Radio Licence is Daylight Robbery*

Cabinet yesterday announced adoption of Principles to a Bill that would be extortionate to motorists in Zimbabwe, who already have to pay very high toll fees and pay a premium at the fuel pump.

Motorists are now required to have a ZBC radio licence (US$23) first before buying vehicle insurance. The government made the changes in a bid to improve revenue collection for loss making media conglomerate ZBC. 

Despite this fee being an unfair tax on already struggling citizens - most motorists use FM modulators to play music from their phones rather than listen to actual radio. Others play CDs while many now play music from their flash drives.

Furthermore, if this Bill is to become actual law - it would have to take into consideration that not all radio stations are affiliated to ZBC. In fact, most ex-Japanese vehicles do not tune into any ZBC frequency.

Therefore, the money would have to benefit all radio stations in the country. ZBC radio stations would have to share the revenue with other national stations such as Star FM and ZiFM, and the provincial and community radio stations.

People have also been asking what happens if someone does not have a radion in their car; this is where it gets messy: one would be required to get an exemption from ZBC - opening floodgates for corruption and other abuses of the facility.

02/05/2024, 17:30 - +263 77 482 5076: 🟣Governor John Mushayavanhu’s reign of confusion continued today as he made yet another U-turn on his Monetary Policy Statement issued barely a month ago. Whereas he had originally announced that the Zimbabwe Dollar and bond notes would circulate until the 30th of April 2024 whereupon they’d cease to be legal tender, he now says bond notes and the ZWL will continue in use indefinitely and “co-circulate” with his ZiG. 

What does this mean for banking and business? Nobody knows. 

This is what happens when policies are implemented without consultation and clear thinking. The confusion of mind exhibited since he started does not bode well for confidence. The lack of certainty around the new currency over the last three weeks is bad for the economy. It’s impossible to plan because things keep changing arbitrarily. 

When we demanded a properly enacted legal framework for the new currency, this is the chaos we hoped would be avoided. Alas. 

It’s a mess.

We need new leaders.🇿🇼

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has gazetted new Intermediated Money Transfer Tax (IMTT) rates for Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) and United States dollars (USD).


Both are now at 2% removing the distortions different rates were having on pricing when applying interbank rates. Previously, it was 2% for local currency and 1% for USD.

----------

This comes after businesses have pleaded with authorities to either reduce the IMTT or scrap it altogether.

Businesses argued that IMTT was a significant additional cost given the several taxes already levied on businesses, therefore the tax had the effect of pushing up the prices of goods and services.

As reported by The Sunday Mail, IMTT is a tax levied on electronic payments or transfers made by either an individual or corporate entity.

The tax does not affect the receiver of the payment but the payer transacting to settle obligations for goods and services received.

Treasury announced the new changes to IMTT through Statutory Instrument 80 of 2024, which reads:


> IT is hereby notified that the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion has, in terms of section 3 of the Finance Act [Chapter 23:04], made the following regulations:-

> 1. These regulations may be cited as the Finance (Amendment of Sections 22B and 22G) Regulations, 2024.

> Amendment of Section 22B

> 2. Section 22B (“Automated Financial Transactions Tax”) is amended by the repeal of Section 22B(a) and substitution with the following-

> “(a) for each withdrawal above the local currency equivalent of one hundred United States dollars, a local currency equivalent of zero comma zero five United States dollars.”.

> Amendment of Section 22G

> 3. Section 22G (“Intermediated Money Transfer Tax”) is repealed and substituted by-

> “22G Intermediated Money Transfer Tax

> The intermediated money transfer tax chargeable in terms of –

> (a) section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two on every Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable:

> Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of five hundred thousand United States dollars (at the prevailing interbank rate) a flat intermediated money transfer tax of the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of ten thousand one hundred and fifty United States dollars (at the prevailing interbank rate) shall be chargeable on such transaction; or

> (b) section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two on every United States dollar or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable:

> Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds five hundred thousand United States dollars a flat intermediated money transfer tax of ten thousand one hundred and fifty United States dollars shall be chargeable on such transaction; or

> (c) section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two United States dollars on every dollar of every outbound foreign payment or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable;

> (d) section 36G(3) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of zero comma zero two United States dollars on every Zimbabwe gold-backed digital token or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable.”

07/05/2024, 07:37 - Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior: Top eye specialist loses US$108 000 in crypto deal: Renowned eye specialist Solomon Guramatunhu allegedly lost US$108 924 to a crypto currency trader. Lloyd Chiyangwa (31) appeared before Harare regional magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa, who remanded him in custody pending bail ruling. He is also challenging his placement on remand. Prosecuting, Lancelot Mutsokoti alleged that sometime in 2020, Guramatunhu bought crypto currency while in India from a company in the United Kingdom. He returned to Zimbabwe where he engaged Chiyangwa, who trades in crypto currency. Chiyangwa was tasked to set up wallets and five accounts namely Trust, Exodus, Cosmostation, Wemix and Metamask and to set up passwords for these wallets. Between January 7 and January 27, 2024 Chiyangwa transferred 122,467 matic tokens worth US$108 924.24 from Guramatunhu’s Metamask wallet to Waybit exchange. The court heard that Guramatunhu discovered that the tokens were stolen on January 27, 2024 when he intended to move them into another wallet. Chiyangwa is suspected to have used his cellphone to make the transaction. The suspect has other pending court cases where he is facing similar charges – Herald, Tuesday May 7, Pg 5

The rehabilitation of some roads in Harare for the 44th Southern African Development Community (SADC) Heads of State and Government Summit has resulted in congestion and traffic chaos in the capital.

Harare Mayor, Councillor Jacob Mafume, said he will seek an urgent meeting with the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Development, Felix Mhona, to address the traffic congestion.

Mafume said the rehabilitation of roads has heavily affected people living in areas like Harare West where the roads that lead to the New Parliament building in Mt Hampden are situated. Said Mafume:


> We need to urgently address this issue with the Minister of Transport. The works on the city centre roads and those leading to the new Parliament have worsened the situation.

> We had been promised that upgrading of Julius Nyerere would take just three weeks but now it’s more than two months.

> People are spending 4 hours going to work and another 4 hours going back home. Many are failing to get to the airport on time, some are missing important engagements.

> The traffic situation is terrible, something has to be done. The residents are suffering.


Mafume said he might also seek an audience with the companies doing the road rehabilitation for them to state their timelines.

At least 40 greater roads in and around the city have been lined up for the rehabilitation exercise.

The roads where the ministry shall apply asphaltic concrete overlay includes Samora Machel (Jaggers to Kuwadzana Roundabout), Dieppe roundabout, Glenara/Samora junction, Glenara/ED Mnangagwa Road, Chiremba (through Braeside), Robert Mugabe/Abdel Gamal Nasser, Josiah Tongogara, Harare Drive roundabout Jaggers, Lomagundi Road (selected sections), Simon Muzenda Street/Robert Mugabe junction to Tongogara Road, and Simon Muzenda Street/Robert Mugabe junction to Tongogara Road.

The person swipped for is a law enforcement officer deployed under cover to weed out people using unofficial rate. We may be  put in an awkward situation by people we think we are helping🙆🏻‍♂️.

19/03/2024, 09:05 - Rufaro: Good morning sir after consulting the bank and communicating with them i have decided to instead build an AI agent for the bank that studies trends and analyses customer preferences to use to for advertising and recommending the banks products and services.
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Mr Zvakafa: Put it in writing
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Mr Zvakafa: Send it to me
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Rufaro: Okay sir let me make a quick draft for you
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Mr Zvakafa: Note time is not on your side
19/03/2024, 09:43 - Rufaro: yes sir i understand
19/03/2024, 09:44 - Mr Zvakafa: Look for a data set that can enable.training of the model of the  recomender engine
19/03/2024, 09:45 - Rufaro: Understood sir

25/03/2024, 09:02 - Rufaro: good morning sir i hope you saw my new proposal that i sent last week
25/03/2024, 09:50 - Mr Zvakafa: Let me look ar it
25/03/2024, 09:54 - Rufaro: Okay thank you
25/03/2024, 10:31 - Mr Zvakafa: Cab you explain to me via text or maybe audio how the chatbot will work in production
25/03/2024, 10:33 - Rufaro: Okay let me try and record an audio
25/03/2024, 10:34 - Mr Zvakafa: From all our conversations , I have received 3 ideas from you. This was the first one
25/03/2024, 10:35 - Mr Zvakafa: This was the second one that you mentioned and you said this was after consulting the bank
25/03/2024, 10:33 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
25/03/2024, 10:35 - Mr Zvakafa: Today I have received the third one
25/03/2024, 10:35 - Mr Zvakafa: This was a recommendation engine for banking products
25/03/2024, 10:36 - Mr Zvakafa: This one is securing
25/03/2024, 10:39 - Mr Zvakafa: I have seen you changing ideas. What's obvious is you want to do a project that utilize AI for your bank but you are not sure which area do you want to focus on.This complicates and hinders your progress .I am not even sure that after giving you recommendations, will you take them or you will go and find a new idea
25/03/2024, 10:40 - Rufaro: Yes sir sorry about the increase in the number of ideas. You see for the other ideas i end up running into some obstacles mostly on the legal side. regarding access to some of the banks documents. One department can encourage me to try and set up a certain system handling certain information while another department can be very uncomfortable with having to deal with me regarding that mentioned area you see so i am trying to focus more on a project that would avoid or manevuer around their policies. As i do still need support from them on these such systems.
25/03/2024, 10:44 - Rufaro: No sir , I do apologize if it does seem like i am disregarding your advice. It's just i am finding it difficult to try and justify otherwise how i can make a project unique with the environment i am in. I do not mean to offend you
25/03/2024, 10:45 - Mr Zvakafa: We have started this journey already and I am your supervisor. One of my duties is to help you craft a research topic ideal for a 3rd year student. Therefore when you meet glitches or you realize it's not feasible you communicate with me .Any change must be communicated. This is why feasibility studies are key
25/03/2024, 10:46 - Rufaro: Okay sir
25/03/2024, 10:46 - Mr Zvakafa: I am here to help you come up with a solid research idea that you can put into production in your company
25/03/2024, 10:48 - Rufaro: Okay sir
25/03/2024, 10:49 - Mr Zvakafa: It's either you integrate your solution with CBZ infrastructure or you use alternative infrastructure. Some companies won't even allow you to use their data.So you look for alternative data sets or you create alternative infrastructure. Laiter on you put it into production as per the banking regulations
25/03/2024, 10:52 - Rufaro: Okay i understand. Because this side what happened is that the Bank seems to have had a change in some of their policies which are still being communicated to the people supervising me hear and i understand that some other decisions are still in the air regarding those who are working in IT so a new policy can be announced today that could affect my project which is why i was now aiming for a project where the user optionally generates the dataset over time
25/03/2024, 10:53 - Rufaro: I want to avoid capturing any confidential data on my own and only use information that is somewhat readily available or always on display something like vocabulary and speech patterns which are if anything made public by individuals willingly especially since that is necessary for users to interact with the bank and its services
25/03/2024, 10:59 - Mr Zvakafa: If I did get you.You want to use a chatbot to capture users information(that is their user names and passwords  etc).You store the data.You train a nlp model based on this data .The model will be able  to know if this is the real user? And also you mainly want the data for data recovery
25/03/2024, 11:02 - Rufaro: Yes sir the dataset will be generated on the user regularly with each login the chatbot will try and prompt them to speak so the model learns more about them and incase they change how they speak after a while. They will be prompted regularly on each login with a pin and when the model wishes to verify who they are, it may request they write a short paragraph about anything so it compares the way they communicate to the data it has in its dataset
25/03/2024, 11:03 - Rufaro: *I mean each time after they login with a pin they will be prompted to communicate with the chatbot.
25/03/2024, 11:06 - Rufaro: It won't demand the user write whole essays but just short paragraphs of maybe even 50 to 100 words or more if the user wishes to enter more information. this data will accumulate in a data set where an algorithm will study the speech patterns and register that pattern under the user of that account. similarities to that pattern will be analyzed when it comes verfication of a user
25/03/2024, 11:33 - Mr Zvakafa: So you are focusing on both speech and text
25/03/2024, 11:35 - Mr Zvakafa: I don't know wether you will build good data pipelines that will collect the data in real time
25/03/2024, 11:35 - Mr Zvakafa: Data pipelines will be critical
25/03/2024, 11:35 - Rufaro: Yes speech and text i want to make it applicable to even situations where users do not have the ability to enter audio or text input
25/03/2024, 11:37 - Mr Zvakafa: Focus on situation. It's good to be ambitious but narrow your scope and know your target group
25/03/2024, 11:38 - Rufaro: Okay sir i will try my best then. How about i will focus on text first then move on to speech after text pattern recognition is successful
25/03/2024, 11:41 - Mr Zvakafa: That's why I have said  try to focus on one thing rather than both speech and text
25/03/2024, 11:42 - Mr Zvakafa: You will need to build data pipelines that collect all this big data
25/03/2024, 11:42 - Mr Zvakafa: AI applications need more data
25/03/2024, 11:43 - Mr Zvakafa: You collect the data , and the data must be appropriate with the machine learning model you are using
25/03/2024, 11:44 - Mr Zvakafa: Are creating your own machine learning algorithm or you are creating your own algorithm???
25/03/2024, 11:46 - Rufaro: I intend to create my own algorithm and i will be using other online algorithms for reference however if i find an algorithm that is already in use i will use that algorithm instead and will only modify it slightly
25/03/2024, 11:46 - Mr Zvakafa: The security aspect using AI must be clear as in how are you using the chatbot and the nlp model to enforce security
25/03/2024, 11:47 - Mr Zvakafa: If you are creating your own algorithm then you have to prove its accuracy benchmarking with other algorithms in existence
25/03/2024, 11:47 - Mr Zvakafa: I did not get the last objective?
25/03/2024, 11:49 - Rufaro: The model is to be used to verify the users identity like a password does on entry. The AI will try and recognize the user by comparing the text input to the text data in the dataset and will grant them access or deny it to them depending on  whether the patterns it analyzes are the same.
25/03/2024, 11:51 - Rufaro: Oh like that is were the secure part is. The Idea is that the chatbot will give a go ahead to the backend service to grant you access to the account or services you want like lets say data recovery as i mentioned. It will recognize you as the owner of the account and grant you access to said account so you can enter and maybe even change your password if you forgot it
25/03/2024, 11:54 - Mr Zvakafa: You will have these components:

 1.Website that you integrate with the web chatbot
2.Back end comprising of the data infrastructure(Data pipelines)
3. Machine learning model that you will put into production enforcing the security you are talking about
4. Good data collection will be critical because that's what affects your model. You will continuously monitor your model in production to see if the accuracy is still the same. So you first train the model using the data set you are saying you will collect(Data lake)
25/03/2024, 11:55 - Rufaro: yes sir those are the components that i will have in my project
25/03/2024, 11:56 - Mr Zvakafa: What's hhe difference between a client entering credentials using a web form and  using a web chatbot??
25/03/2024, 11:57 - Mr Zvakafa: Then your data engineering  and machine learning skills  have  to be shaperned
25/03/2024, 11:59 - Mr Zvakafa: I don't know how many CBZ cliemts are using  online web based  banking . I have been using CBZ for the last 7 years.I have never used web banking services. I prefer  the mobile app cbz touch because it does nor require data for me to bank
25/03/2024, 12:02 - Mr Zvakafa: Don't use the word aims. Coz we have one  aim 
Be specific on you aim.Dont mention functionalities of the app in the aim
25/03/2024, 12:02 - Rufaro: Okay sir noted
25/03/2024, 12:03 - Mr Zvakafa: It's not necessary when writting an academic document to mention during the time at cbz  what what
25/03/2024, 12:04 - Mr Zvakafa: At the end of this project you will produce a smart product(Web chatbot) that enforces security in the bank
25/03/2024, 12:05 - Rufaro: I want to open the possibility to tracking individuals who repeatedly try and gain access to the accounts of other users by generating a digital identity that marks users like that with a digital identity that identifies them as a threat to the banks security.
25/03/2024, 12:06 - Mr Zvakafa: So  make it clear how this solution is the best for security purposes comparing other bots like whatsapp chatbot or mobile forms like those on other existing applications like cbz touch
25/03/2024, 12:07 - Mr Zvakafa: Are you saying this  cannot be achieved through mobile.if that's so then make it clear in your do document
25/03/2024, 12:09 - Mr Zvakafa: I think i have replied you. Let me get down to business
25/03/2024, 12:10 - Rufaro: Okay sir thank you very much for your time i will do my best with your help
10/04/2024, 16:24 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
14/04/2024, 10:22 - Mr Zvakafa: <Media omitted>
14/04/2024, 10:22 - Mr Zvakafa: In your aim how many models do you want to create??
14/04/2024, 10:23 - Mr Zvakafa: Do u have a data set to train these models
14/04/2024, 10:24 - Mr Zvakafa: What's the characteristics of your training data set
14/04/2024, 10:30 - Mr Zvakafa: To developa machine learning model that does 1.2.3 utilizing  1.2.3
14/04/2024, 10:31 - Mr Zvakafa: I have told you so many times objectives start with to  to to
14/04/2024, 10:32 - Mr Zvakafa: Objective 1 you want to create or aquire.What is it that you want to do??
14/04/2024, 10:32 - Rufaro: Okay sir sorry let me fix that
14/04/2024, 10:34 - Rufaro: I want to make use of an AWE to assess an individuals writing skills. So far I have been still trying to find out which is most ideal to use an already designed AWE or to create one from an available ML model
14/04/2024, 10:36 - Mr Zvakafa: Objective 2 is
 to collect data entered from users etc using a web application
14/04/2024, 10:36 - Rufaro: to assess writing perfomance I have the IELTs dataset provided by kaggle
14/04/2024, 10:38 - Mr Zvakafa: Make it clear whether u want to create or you want to make use of an existing AWEn
14/04/2024, 10:38 - Mr Zvakafa: This is 14 and you don't know kuti ndiri kuda kushandisa chii
14/04/2024, 10:39 - Rufaro: Yes I wish to create a simple interface similar to the one on touch where the question is on top followed by a multiline textbox. The user will answer the question in the form of two or more paragraphs then they submit their answer. I will the convert the text to a suitable format using a pipeline I will create using tools provided by sklearn then store it in a dataset
14/04/2024, 10:40 - Mr Zvakafa: Make it clear what you want to do
14/04/2024, 10:41 - Mr Zvakafa: In a nutshell rephraise for me that objective. The way I understand that objective is you want to just collect data using the web application ( ofcourse through various forms)
14/04/2024, 10:43 - Rufaro: Okay I want to collect data from the user using a Web application. The data will be text based.
14/04/2024, 10:44 - Rufaro: On submission it is added to a dataset in the backend and then processed later by the model
14/04/2024, 10:44 - Mr Zvakafa: Are u training the model online(streaming) or batch
14/04/2024, 10:45 - Mr Zvakafa: So you will train the model using the generated data
14/04/2024, 10:45 - Mr Zvakafa: ??
14/04/2024, 10:46 - Rufaro: The AWE will be trained using the IELTs data set which is batch training
14/04/2024, 10:47 - Rufaro: The second model the user predictor will use streaming
14/04/2024, 10:47 - Rufaro: I intend to control the number of users who will help train it so I can get data that is as accurate as possible
14/04/2024, 10:48 - Mr Zvakafa: Third objective make it clear  that I want to develop a machine learning model .on its own the Word model is too broad. Models utilize various techniques. In this case u are creating a machine learning model
14/04/2024, 10:50 - Mr Zvakafa: The reason why I am asking  is machine learning models  must be trained using  large   data sets so that the prediction is accurate
14/04/2024, 10:51 - Rufaro: Okay I wish to create a model that uses a DecisionTree to make predictions. The features it will look at will include the users score after AWE's assessment, the question they were answering , the length of their answer and the word order they used
14/04/2024, 10:51 - Mr Zvakafa: You must be able to differentiate whether your problem is a classification problem or regression problem  or a reinforcement problem. You must understand the problem
14/04/2024, 10:52 - Rufaro: I understand sir I will try my best to make the audience as large as possible I will try and get permission to openly stream the model as well
14/04/2024, 10:52 - Mr Zvakafa: For now I don't want features..I just neeed to know the objective
14/04/2024, 10:53 - Mr Zvakafa: What performance measure will use on the model??
14/04/2024, 10:54 - Rufaro: Okay sir I wish to use a Classifier model
14/04/2024, 10:56 - Rufaro: I wish to use an accuracy score. The model will compare how close it predictions are to the dataset
14/04/2024, 10:58 - Mr Zvakafa: In an objective you just tell us the objective as it is . 

Example

To create a machine leaning model utilizing  supports vector machine to predict 1.2.3 things 

You objective must be measurable. Be specific
14/04/2024, 10:58 - Mr Zvakafa: Research more on the performance measure
14/04/2024, 10:58 - Rufaro: Okay sir
14/04/2024, 11:00 - Mr Zvakafa: Make your aim understandable. Make it clear so that the reader don't find problems in understanding it
14/04/2024, 11:00 - Rufaro: My objective is 

To create a machine learning model that utilises decision tree classifiers to predict the likelihood of the user being the intended client of the account
14/04/2024, 11:01 - Mr Zvakafa: On the last part of the objective you can add a part on how you wil solve that problem in context
14/04/2024, 11:01 - Mr Zvakafa: That's more understandable  now
14/04/2024, 11:02 - Rufaro: Noted sir
14/04/2024, 11:02 - Mr Zvakafa: List your objectives in  chronological order
14/04/2024, 11:02 - Mr Zvakafa: Know what starts first
14/04/2024, 11:03 - Mr Zvakafa: The AWE feeds into the data pipeline
14/04/2024, 11:04 - Rufaro: Noted
14/04/2024, 11:04 - Rufaro: Yes the AWE will also feed its output into the data pipeline as well
14/04/2024, 11:04 - Mr Zvakafa: A data pipeline is just  data processing infrastructure that takes data form various sources  .in the context of the bank you might need data coming from various sources
14/04/2024, 11:05 - Rufaro: Noted

14/04/2024, 11:11 - Rufaro: Thank you very much for your assistance
22/04/2024, 08:20 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
22/04/2024, 08:20 - Rufaro: Sorry for late submission
23/04/2024, 18:30 - Mr Zvakafa: We are now writting a thesis document
23/04/2024, 18:30 - Mr Zvakafa: We format as we write the document
23/04/2024, 18:31 - Mr Zvakafa: We build on from chapter one .I need a document with chapter 1, 2, 3 combined
23/04/2024, 18:31 - Mr Zvakafa: Formatting and academic writing is key
23/04/2024, 18:32 - Mr Zvakafa: Kwete kundipa zvidimbu zvidimbu
24/04/2024, 12:42 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
24/04/2024, 12:52 - Mr Zvakafa: Noted .will look at it
05/05/2024, 05:29 - Mr Zvakafa: Objective 2 , I don't understand the first part if that Objective
05/05/2024, 05:31 - Mr Zvakafa: <Media omitted>
05/05/2024, 05:32 - Mr Zvakafa: Objective 3 , don't say other
05/05/2024, 05:35 - Mr Zvakafa: On your aim . The aim is to create a system(wether web /mobile ) that utilizes machine learning. So the objective is to develop a system
05/05/2024, 06:35 - Rufaro: Sorry must have been a typing error Objective 2 is: To create a pipeline that will prepare the data for an AWE to assess the grammar in the entered response and feed the response data to the user authenticator model.
05/05/2024, 06:35 - Rufaro: Noted
05/05/2024, 06:38 - Rufaro: Okay the how about say :To create an AWE model using openai's get model and NLP libraries to assess the grammar and vocabulary from user response and feed the result back into the pipeline
05/05/2024, 07:14 - Mr Zvakafa: All I can say is don't give us  multiple meanings be specific
05/05/2024, 07:15 - Mr Zvakafa: U can't say other we become curious what is the other
05/05/2024, 07:20 - Rufaro: Noted

17/03/2024, 12:44 - Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them. Tap to learn more.
18/03/2024, 10:46 - Rufaro: good morning
18/03/2024, 10:56 - Ngoni: Hey
18/03/2024, 10:56 - Ngoni: How is it
18/03/2024, 11:02 - Rufaro: it is good the phone is doing pretty well too and i fixed the issue with netone yesterday
18/03/2024, 11:03 - Rufaro: now i realize i also probably wasted my time just watching youtube videos once it started working though i really need to improve my perfomance i think.
18/03/2024, 11:03 - Ngoni: Which performance do you need to improve?
18/03/2024, 11:04 - Rufaro: focus i mean like writing code even on weekends or could it just be my environment maybe that is causing issues
18/03/2024, 11:06 - Rufaro: i can write code at work
18/03/2024, 11:30 - Ngoni: Probably the environment
18/03/2024, 11:31 - Ngoni: Electricity, no table etc
18/03/2024, 11:31 - Rufaro: yeah with all them kids coming around and asking for guavas making demands yelling shouting and screaming at each other i think i will start coming to work even on weekends sometimes so i can do some research and study a bit
18/03/2024, 11:32 - Rufaro: should do me some good
18/03/2024, 11:34 - Ngoni: Yeah, that could help
18/03/2024, 11:34 - Ngoni: Or you could buy a desk and those laptop powerbanks
18/03/2024, 11:35 - Rufaro: laptop powerbank? There is stuff like that out ther e
18/03/2024, 11:35 - Rufaro: interesting
18/03/2024, 11:41 - Ngoni: Yep. A good cost about 60 to a hundred
18/03/2024, 11:45 - Rufaro: okay do they have ones that can take my type of charger though or are they for c Type chargers
20/03/2024, 08:00 - Rufaro: Good morning my guy i spoke to mainini Tino yesterday
20/03/2024, 08:18 - Ngoni: And what happened?
20/03/2024, 08:20 - Rufaro: Oh she says she fine though she is traumatized from the robbery . Babamunini suspects that the robbers could come back for her
20/03/2024, 08:36 - Ngoni: They didn't hurt her did they?
20/03/2024, 08:42 - Rufaro: she locked her room and they could not get in she did however hear her employees crying and begging for help but she did not come out cause she was terrified
20/03/2024, 08:42 - Rufaro: apparently one of her employees was seriously injured and she has been buying medicine for him though and the others are fine
20/03/2024, 08:44 - Ngoni: Where was this?
20/03/2024, 08:45 - Rufaro: I think dad said in Chirundu
20/03/2024, 08:47 - Ngoni: Hmm, how unfortunate
20/03/2024, 08:48 - Ngoni: If they can come back for her then she's in a lot of danger
20/03/2024, 08:48 - Ngoni: Means they'd have to invest into a lot of security
20/03/2024, 08:49 - Rufaro: yep the thing is that they decided to rob her because that day they saw she bought a pool table and brought it in a good truck to her store or something that is what she said so she did report to police and she believes that the CID are getting involved so we can just hope for the best
20/03/2024, 08:49 - Rufaro: Probably guys like fawcet or something cause otherwise they will be in trouble
20/03/2024, 09:55 - Rufaro: hey dude i wanna know when you do psychometric tests how often do you get people with similar results or behaviours or are all the results unique for each and every  individual who takes the test or will ever take the test. If these individuals take the same test repetitively or a different test do you get the same results regardless
20/03/2024, 10:16 - Ngoni: They might have known
20/03/2024, 10:16 - Ngoni: Yep
20/03/2024, 10:18 - Ngoni: Well, you could improve especially on things like English and math, but it's mostly unique when it comes to personality assessment. But not entirely unique since personalities can be somewhat grouped together
20/03/2024, 10:21 - Rufaro: Okay Okay i see the thing is i am trying to try and formulate a way of user authentication using AI instead of a person having to use security questions or password or pincode. So you know like a  user simply frequently interacts with an AI agent and that AI agent learns who the user is and can recognize them whenever it interacts with them so it can log them in to their user.
20/03/2024, 10:22 - Rufaro: The idea is it collects information from the user and uses that information as the dataset and then gives the user access to whatever account they are using. It would be a more convenient means of security for users and might be a whole lot more secure the more and individual interacts with the AI
20/03/2024, 10:35 - Ngoni: More secure than biometrics?
20/03/2024, 10:35 - Ngoni: And how is one contacting this agent?
20/03/2024, 10:36 - Rufaro: well it will not be more secure than biometrics but is likely to just be more economically physible as the idea is to add it to android applications and make it more convenient for the customer.
22/03/2024, 11:25 - Rufaro: good morning how are you
22/03/2024, 11:28 - Ngoni: Yo
22/03/2024, 11:28 - Ngoni: How's it
22/03/2024, 11:30 - Rufaro: Oh it is cool so i Yesterday the bus i boarded ended up running out of fuel when we were like a kilometre from showgrounds imagine and the driver was like eish things are hard guys you know these buses die sometimes. and this other guy at the back of the bus was like the conditions of you not reaching a destination with this here bus of yours to leave us home is that you give us back 50 cents so give me my money nigga
22/03/2024, 11:39 - Ngoni: Sounds hectic
22/03/2024, 11:39 - Ngoni: Did he give it back?
22/03/2024, 11:40 - Rufaro: Of course not man people was upset though and the passengers was like you get us to domboshava late and your bus breaks down before we can get home you know what we promise not to board buses that belong to your company.🤣🤣🤣🤣
22/03/2024, 11:41 - Rufaro: The issue is there companies know how us residents of domboshava respond to poor service and they try and punish us for deciding not waste our money on their terribly service and the customers from domboshava just smirk and are like screw you guess what there are open trucks and combis always available so these guys lose more customers by the day as they remain prideful and conceited.
22/03/2024, 12:39 - Ngoni: You'd obviously be mad coz man probably figured his fuel might not get home😂😂
22/03/2024, 12:41 - Ngoni: Well, nobody likes poor service, so it makes sense. But it seems like it's a lot of commotion with the transport that side.
22/03/2024, 12:53 - Rufaro: i know and some guys came with their kombi and were like domboshava 50 cents and guess what the customers where like we would rather walk the whole kilometre
25/03/2024, 12:09 - Ngoni: Yo
25/03/2024, 12:09 - Ngoni: So I was rewatching one punch season 2
25/03/2024, 12:09 - Ngoni: Besides some of the animation, I think the story wasn't so bad
25/03/2024, 12:10 - Ngoni: Oh and konosuba is coming back in 16 days
25/03/2024, 12:11 - Rufaro: yeah sure i mean studio JC had issues because of how they had some cutscenes where the characters seemed to be pausing or sticking mid battle
25/03/2024, 12:11 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
25/03/2024, 12:12 - Rufaro: Also i want to say some of the netflix animations that are not Kengan Ashura are bad as hell , Have you ever watched gamera
25/03/2024, 12:12 - Ngoni: The animation wasn't all that
25/03/2024, 12:12 - Rufaro: I know people somehow like frieren But Gintama though what is happening in Gintama right now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
25/03/2024, 12:12 - Ngoni: Nah, which one is that one?
25/03/2024, 12:13 - Ngoni: Frieren is good, but mmm, it can't be number 1 tho😂
25/03/2024, 12:14 - Ngoni: These guys are ranking frieren higher than HXH and JJK
25/03/2024, 12:14 - Rufaro: kind of another Godzilla like storyline animation with Kaiju and all the worst part about gamera was like you could feel as though the writers of the storyline where lazy cause they did have a story and characters among the kaiju who had potential . I would only recommend watching episode 4 cause they introduce this thing called Guiron and it is really unique in the monster universe even the way it fought it was good and it had potential .
25/03/2024, 12:15 - Rufaro: Like they introduced a character that had one piece level of ridiculous design but that character is the most dangerous entity because of how they move and fight uniquely and then they had to ruin it with the idea that the hero of the anime cannot lose kind of logic
25/03/2024, 12:17 - Rufaro: Did you see the blu ray version of Sukuna vs Mahoraga cause hmmmm that fight scene was unbelievable like when people say mahoraga is dangeroud he is dangerous and sukuna is also indeed strong like damn they added extra scenes and even showed sukuna having fun but the fun started to run out a bit when mahoraga started shadow boxing intentionally trying to hit the slashes so he could adapt and see them.
25/03/2024, 12:17 - Rufaro: did HxH get a new season and frieren can't be more popular than AOT can it
25/03/2024, 12:21 - Ngoni: You begin to wonder if Netflix doesn't have the budget to get some good writers. They can animate for real but the stories tho. I'll check it out
25/03/2024, 12:21 - Ngoni: I ain't seen it, where can i get it
25/03/2024, 12:21 - Ngoni: Nope HXH doesn't have a new season although I've heard rumors that it could be coming
25/03/2024, 12:22 - Ngoni: Definitely frieren can't be more popular than aot, I think it's just a new concept, that's why people like it
25/03/2024, 12:23 - Ngoni: They have good story telling and the characters have depth
25/03/2024, 12:23 - Rufaro: yeah like the fight scene with guiron you could swear it was good CGI and it made sense but the main character won cause he was the main character and the story as a whole if it starts as comedy action end it as comedy action like gintama but these guys wanted to put some horror and slice of life story into the mix like what . These are giant monsters fighting each other for whatever reason let them just fight
25/03/2024, 12:25 - Rufaro: Or maybe it just one of the better new generation anime that doesn't abuse a certain genre like the reincarnation and fantasy series. They become more popular if you are breaking away from following a popular trope right down to the last script after all. Its like one puch man saitama already became the most powerful being in existence and doesn't have any super sad backstory or want to be loved by everyone and yet people like the anime for how simple he makes things
25/03/2024, 17:14 - Ngoni: It sucks when that happens. We need convincing wins in anime
25/03/2024, 17:15 - Ngoni: People get tired of the same isekai stuff, so yeah, frieren is somewhat refreshing and it's got depth
26/03/2024, 10:51 - Rufaro: yo wassup have you ever done machine learning and is it easy or just challenging
26/03/2024, 11:47 - Ngoni: It requires a lot of learning
26/03/2024, 11:47 - Ngoni: It's a big challenging but not impossible
26/03/2024, 11:49 - Rufaro: Okay cause i was chatting with my supervisor and he was asking all sorts of questions cause my project centers around using machine learning to learn a persons communication patterns so it can recognize any given user by looking at how they text and communicate with them.
26/03/2024, 20:34 - Ngoni: Hmm, texting huh🤔
26/03/2024, 20:34 - Ngoni: How do you want to teach it?
27/03/2024, 08:16 - Rufaro: collect info like text messages from users by having it prompt users to enter text.
27/03/2024, 08:17 - Rufaro: Then store their responses and look at how they speak maybe even record key presses and predict the kind of errors in texting they make and how often along with the topics they usually speak about and how they answer questions
27/03/2024, 09:33 - Ngoni: You'd probably need large amounts of text.  How are you going to collect it?
27/03/2024, 10:22 - Rufaro: shit that is a challenge indeed like how much do you think i would need anyway
27/03/2024, 10:23 - Rufaro: cause the first thing i could try and do would be to load some of my assignments for the meantime into the application or i could try and type just some general information into a notepad file frequently and feed it to my dataset.
27/03/2024, 10:24 - Rufaro: another option would be to be able to export and filter whatsapp chat messages to the bot so they can be used as a dataset as well
27/03/2024, 10:39 - Ngoni: As much as possible. Recognizing patterns in text is like looking for needle in a haystack so yeah, a lot
27/03/2024, 10:40 - Ngoni: Who's WhatsApp messages?
27/03/2024, 10:40 - Ngoni: The hard thing about you task is the data
27/03/2024, 10:41 - Ngoni: You'd need different peoples data to confirm that it can identify them
27/03/2024, 10:41 - Rufaro: i guess for now the user so for test that will be my whatsapp messages i guess i will do my best and try and see what i can do to accomplish my task
27/03/2024, 10:41 - Ngoni: Okay
27/03/2024, 10:42 - Rufaro: i will ask for some from my friends of course i guess man i may have bitten off mo than i can chew but that supervisor is getting rather upset or dissatsified with me changing ideas for projects
27/03/2024, 14:01 - Rufaro: Yo are you going to meet Dad in Marondera this Easter
27/03/2024, 19:13 - Ngoni: You first need to understand what's required for the project, breaking it down step by step coz the idea may sound good but without sufficient knowledge you'll struggle
27/03/2024, 19:14 - Ngoni: Probably, but he's talking about kumusha
28/03/2024, 12:53 - Rufaro: I know he also mentioned that he might be going to Marondera as well so i was hoping to get the opportunity to go and visit dad over the weekend
28/03/2024, 13:32 - Rufaro: Oh and a friend of mine wanted to do AI and machine learning but as it it turns out that is not the best decision for the project he wants to use
03/04/2024, 08:12 - Rufaro: good morning i got home safe yesterday and was too tired to even be able to cook yet i had to still draw water from the well and clean some of the dishes that i left yesterday
03/04/2024, 08:12 - Rufaro: i ended up just eating chicken inn for dinner and two slices of bread
04/04/2024, 08:37 - Ngoni: Yo
04/04/2024, 08:37 - Ngoni: You bought a 2 piecer?
04/04/2024, 08:42 - Rufaro: 1 piecer
04/04/2024, 08:43 - Rufaro: a plastiic bag and one coke
04/04/2024, 08:43 - Rufaro: it cost over 100000 rtgs
04/04/2024, 08:43 - Ngoni: Oh I see
04/04/2024, 08:43 - Ngoni: 100000??😂 ih
04/04/2024, 08:44 - Rufaro: you have no idea the rate is flying my guy like everyday it goes up and stores try and predict what it will be at tomorrow and use tomorrows rate
04/04/2024, 08:45 - Ngoni: Yeah, that's a lot for real
04/04/2024, 09:29 - Ngoni: Konosuba is back
04/04/2024, 11:39 - Rufaro: Yes finally been Waiting forever
04/04/2024, 11:51 - Ngoni: So there's this course that I bought. It's on udemy. I can give you my credentials and you can use them to log in
04/04/2024, 11:51 - Ngoni: So download udemy app
04/04/2024, 11:51 - Ngoni: It's on AI

05/04/2024, 08:10 - Rufaro: or do they work fast often
05/04/2024, 08:11 - Ngoni: You ask them to use the deposit machine. Should take about 5 minutes
05/04/2024, 08:12 - Rufaro: oh they have a deposit machine amazing 👍👍 okay can do will check for the closest stanbic bank and go make the deposit when i meet the guy just tell me when to meet the guy
05/04/2024, 10:36 - Ngoni: You're going to meet a white lady who has a shop in town
05/04/2024, 10:36 - Ngoni: Themi Shein CUSTOMER.vcf (file attached)
05/04/2024, 10:37 - Rufaro: White lady oh you mean she is a foreigner
05/04/2024, 10:37 - Ngoni: She may be Zimbabwean. But she a white lady

05/04/2024, 12:01 - Ngoni: Be careful tho, you never know who's watching
05/04/2024, 12:01 - Ngoni: Have you checked the location of the stanbic bank?
05/04/2024, 12:02 - Rufaro: cool will be don't worry
05/04/2024, 12:02 - Rufaro: let me just check to see
05/04/2024, 12:27 - Rufaro: At the bank now
05/04/2024, 12:34 - Ngoni: You already received the money?
05/04/2024, 12:49 - Rufaro: Finished the depos
05/04/2024, 13:03 - Ngoni: Thanks man
05/04/2024, 13:04 - Ngoni: It didn't take too long right?
05/04/2024, 13:20 - Rufaro: No it didn't also witnessed police brutality and almost got caught up in a public altercation by the parking lot
05/04/2024, 13:29 - Rufaro: yo one of my co workers was just arrested my guy the harare police is useless imagine restraining original culprits of a crime and then those guys escape and you go and capture the witnesses instead
05/04/2024, 13:48 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
06/04/2024, 17:11 - Ngoni: Bokuno hero season 7 has started
07/04/2024, 11:22 - Rufaro: WATCH jojo's bizarre adventure episode one is impressive
07/04/2024, 11:40 - Rufaro: No I just finished episode one and it is amazing fast paced story telling but all key points are easy to catch and they also got good action that is easy to follow
07/04/2024, 12:05 - Ngoni: Isn't it like Gundam? With many different kinds of seasons?
07/04/2024, 12:06 - Rufaro: The story revolves around Dio Brando being so petty the guy just trolls and harrases a single family line for eternity cause he did not like the original heir who was around when he was alive
07/04/2024, 12:06 - Rufaro: This guy is petty he basically returns to harass numerous generations with no real reason
07/04/2024, 12:07 - Rufaro: 🤣🤣🤣 This dude knee jumped the MC's dog just to prove he is better than him imagine
07/04/2024, 12:08 - Rufaro: Even the dog was like wtf😨😨😨 my guy I just wanted to say hi
07/04/2024, 12:08 - Rufaro: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 was a pretty nice first episode for me
07/04/2024, 14:47 - Ngoni: Knee jumped?
07/04/2024, 14:54 - Rufaro: You need to see the scene my guy that was a knee jump on episode one when Dio meets Jojo
07/04/2024, 15:07 - Ngoni: Which jojos is this? I know there's a bunch of them
07/04/2024, 16:19 - Rufaro: I will check which one it is I wanted to start from the first one after all
07/04/2024, 16:28 - Ngoni: Yeah check it out
07/04/2024, 16:28 - Ngoni: Coz I've tried jojos, but I found there's a lot
07/04/2024, 16:29 - Ngoni: Ever been watching something and think hmm, these guys skipped a frame?
07/04/2024, 16:32 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
07/04/2024, 16:36 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
07/04/2024, 16:43 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
07/04/2024, 16:45 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
08/04/2024, 11:29 - Rufaro: Whooo yo there was a hell lot of work to do this weekend man and i did not even know to come to work imagine
08/04/2024, 11:30 - Rufaro: The guys at work were so busy they forgot to call me though they said it would have been better if i was here on saturday or stayed later on Friday
09/04/2024, 09:07 - Rufaro: Have you heard of AWE's dude
09/04/2024, 09:15 - Rufaro: i might be able to use that for my project like imagine if i was to grade people on their perfomance on certain given mini paragraphs they enter so i predict whether it is them or not
09/04/2024, 09:16 - Rufaro: that is another option although i will have a lot of work to do regardless.
09/04/2024, 09:16 - Rufaro: I am still considering the alternative of that and voice recognition though so i will see what happens.
09/04/2024, 09:28 - Ngoni: Must have been real busy huh
09/04/2024, 09:30 - Ngoni: What's that?
09/04/2024, 09:33 - Rufaro: You have no idea oh my manager was like "Tonight some people are not going to sleep so i am going to determine who will not sleep today and it will be (looks at me ) , not you, you should go home". And i am like "Okay " , (he looks at the other lady in my office and is like) "You are staying we need you and , nigel and brendon to be  on standby to help us take the system on live and once you are done we realize there is not merrit in sending you home in a taxi so you are going to sleep at a hotel." In my head i am like "Bruuuuuuh i also wanna sleep over at a hotel like come on man let me stay over"
09/04/2024, 09:33 - Rufaro: Automated Writing Evaluator (AWE) basically using ML to score someone's essay
09/04/2024, 09:34 - Rufaro: i was thinking about using that to try and score peoples answers to the security questions so my system can learn who often has such and such a number of scores and determine who the users is through that score you know.
09/04/2024, 09:37 - Ngoni: Oh, sounds intense. Is it because of the zig thing?
09/04/2024, 09:37 - Ngoni: Oh I see
09/04/2024, 09:38 - Ngoni: How would you be scoring these answers exactly?
09/04/2024, 09:44 - Rufaro: If i maybe score an individuals essay multiple times and store their scores i may be able to make a system that will remember your perfomance overtime that is an idea that i have though i am also considering speech recognition patterns like since voice doesn't change and it may be more convenient and secure although i would need a means to combat things like the new threat that is AI deepfakes and prerecorded audios so i am trying to see which option is better and more practical for me to implement cause i think i can actually get AWE model and then use that model for my project online for free. That is also the same thing i believe is possible for Voice matching system as well.
09/04/2024, 09:44 - Rufaro: I can score them according to the IELTS(International English Language Testing System ) so as long as i have them manually enter information than use grammarly i may be able to make a unique score pattern for each individual who tries to enter information in the system
10/04/2024, 17:28 - Rufaro: Yo wassup
10/04/2024, 17:28 - Rufaro: I saw sekuru Chitanda today and guess what
10/04/2024, 17:29 - Rufaro: People are afraid to bank their bonds cause they think they will get arrested
10/04/2024, 17:42 - Ngoni: For prerecorded stuff you simply ask them to say random things
10/04/2024, 17:42 - Ngoni: Let's see how it gets
10/04/2024, 17:42 - Ngoni: Why would they be arrested?
10/04/2024, 18:02 - Rufaro: If you deposit more than 100000 bond notes the bank will ask you to wait for the FIU they will interrogate you and ask why you have so many bond notes
10/04/2024, 18:35 - Ngoni: Yeah that's scary 😂
10/04/2024, 20:07 - Rufaro: Haha my guy the bank is empty and we gonna lose many more clients
10/04/2024, 21:48 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
11/04/2024, 12:59 - Rufaro: Yo today i made my first model by myself. It predicts the Global sales for dfferent video games over the past years i guess maybe a decade or so but the dataset is huge anyway i think i am getting close enough to create the system that i wished to make you know i can only hope that i manage.
11/04/2024, 13:00 - Rufaro: I am still waiting for feedback from my supervisor though
11/04/2024, 20:55 - Ngoni: how does it not look like real skin?
11/04/2024, 20:56 - Ngoni: that's dope....how big's the dataset?
11/04/2024, 20:56 - Ngoni: Oh i see
11/04/2024, 20:57 - Rufaro: Like you can tell it was like someone just colored it with some shades and stuff
11/04/2024, 20:58 - Rufaro: It's like a really good painting where you gotta squint to tell its a painting
11/04/2024, 20:58 - Rufaro: 1mb I guess still gonna double check if it was really correct tomorrow
11/04/2024, 21:03 - Ngoni: Oh I see
11/04/2024, 21:03 - Ngoni: That's not that big
11/04/2024, 21:04 - Rufaro: However the dataset for the AWE is about 3.6mb
11/04/2024, 21:05 - Rufaro: I will then also create another dataset (relativelysmall for my project to predict tye user interacting with the systemas well )
11/04/2024, 21:05 - Rufaro: Huge datasets take long to make after all
11/04/2024, 21:06 - Ngoni: Alright just do what you can but the bigger the dataset, the better
11/04/2024, 21:07 - Rufaro: Yeah you do have a point let me see what I can do about that cause I could start making one as I am getting ready to develop the model
12/04/2024, 07:44 - Rufaro: Yo new LLM's are being made day  by day and it is unbelievable
12/04/2024, 07:47 - Rufaro: some are just being made by students participating in competitions trying to make ML models for practice
12/04/2024, 07:47 - Ngoni: They are not exactly new. It's the same ones being modified often. Once in a while we have a new LLM but it's usually llama and chat gpt
12/04/2024, 07:48 - Rufaro: No like i understand some people seem to be just building them from the ground up though yeah some of them are using already prebuilt LLM's
12/04/2024, 07:49 - Rufaro: Kaggle provides a lot of datasets that people can use after all to create their models
12/04/2024, 09:06 - Ngoni: Ground up? That's a lot of work
12/04/2024, 09:07 - Rufaro: They like we doing it for educational purposes or something like that
12/04/2024, 09:18 - Ngoni: Oh I see
12/04/2024, 17:26 - Ngoni: Rdc world be like 'one hashira can beat all the titans"
12/04/2024, 17:48 - Rufaro: What is he smoking like come on my guy Don't underestimate them titans
12/04/2024, 17:49 - Rufaro: Is he high cause the female, warhammer , armored would kinda be hard to handle then you gotta deal with the colossal as well
12/04/2024, 17:49 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
12/04/2024, 17:51 - Rufaro: The colossal transforms while he is in 1km radius he is dying worse if its the eren founding titan as well that thing would waste him maybe he could escape
12/04/2024, 17:51 - Rufaro: I see him beating female, cart , jaws , attack ,beast and the abnormal titans
12/04/2024, 17:52 - Rufaro: The armored is a draw probably , the warhammer is a draw the colossal that is a loss no doubt
12/04/2024, 17:52 - Ngoni: Could it transform before the sound hashira has cut off his head? That nigga fast as hell
12/04/2024, 17:53 - Rufaro: If he know who he is fighting before it happens and remember them titans can pull miracles imagine they pull a reigner where they move their consciousness to their spine before you cut his head off automatic transformation
12/04/2024, 17:54 - Rufaro: Everybody is ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
12/04/2024, 17:54 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
12/04/2024, 17:56 - Rufaro: Yeah but the colossal is a nuke if they fails like I was saying to kill him on the first hit you dead its like a cursed sorcerer fighting mahoraga for the first time if he don't die on the first hit you gonna die
12/04/2024, 17:57 - Rufaro: They could beat most of the titans except the abnormal titan shifter eren and the colossal probably
12/04/2024, 17:57 - Rufaro: To beat the colossal they would have to attack after he transforms and runs out of energy basically only way to win
12/04/2024, 17:58 - Ngoni: Those guys cut heads for a living, no way they'd fail that
12/04/2024, 17:59 - Rufaro: Transferring consciousness remember reigner ?
12/04/2024, 17:59 - Rufaro: Maybe cutting him to bits in an instant may work through the neck and torso maybe
12/04/2024, 18:00 - Ngoni: Colossal would fall, even to someone like zenitsu. All he needs to do is run away at lightning speed when it transforms the come back later to strike the neck
12/04/2024, 18:01 - Ngoni: You can't transfer shit if your head is on the floor
12/04/2024, 18:01 - Rufaro: Trainer did it twice the he'll you talking about the second time he didn't even have his head anymore
12/04/2024, 18:02 - Rufaro: Though it could be plot armour
12/04/2024, 18:02 - Rufaro: Will they have plot armour in this fight cause if so eren winning too in normal titan form
12/04/2024, 18:02 - Rufaro: I mean attack titan
12/04/2024, 18:05 - Ngoni: Do you think reiner would able to beat that upper four?
12/04/2024, 18:05 - Rufaro: He would probably die at upper 6 but upper 5 would die that one was a fraud
12/04/2024, 18:07 - Rufaro: I would say eren knowing the future may be a problem for even upper 3 maybe even 1 depending on what future he sees cause I believe the ability to see the future affects it as well
12/04/2024, 18:07 - Ngoni: In the demon slayer world,  those titans don't really stand a chance. They're too slow and have obvious weaknesses.
12/04/2024, 18:08 - Ngoni: Eren's too slow
12/04/2024, 18:08 - Rufaro: Don't underestimate them though if they catch off guard it would mean death
12/04/2024, 18:50 - Rufaro: Here is another take one piece pirate's vs ninjas from naruto even gecko moria could beat a number of them ninjas
12/04/2024, 18:51 - Rufaro: And whitebeard in his prime can can beat pain
12/04/2024, 19:47 - Ngoni: Mmm that's a difficult one now
12/04/2024, 19:48 - Ngoni: Which ninjas, there's too many of them
12/04/2024, 20:04 - Rufaro: Gecko Maria vs hidan or deidara
12/04/2024, 20:04 - Rufaro: Crocodile vs gaara
12/04/2024, 20:05 - Rufaro: Fujitora vs kakashi or obito
15/04/2024, 17:19 - Rufaro: Afternoon
15/04/2024, 17:23 - Ngoni: Yo
15/04/2024, 17:23 - Ngoni: How's it
15/04/2024, 17:31 - Rufaro: Was doing a bit of ml today and guess what preprocessing is hard phew
15/04/2024, 17:33 - Rufaro: Sklearn gives a lot of tools and models that can be used for building your own models but the part about preprocessing maybe one of the hardest parts
15/04/2024, 17:33 - Rufaro: How was work
15/04/2024, 17:44 - Ngoni: It's a lot of work dude. Did you manage to create a good enough dataset?
15/04/2024, 17:44 - Rufaro: Not yet need to decide the parameters of my dataset
15/04/2024, 17:45 - Rufaro: First I will get short paragraphs from my audiences I guess
15/04/2024, 17:45 - Rufaro: Should probably use Microsoft forms for convenience
15/04/2024, 18:09 - Ngoni: Oh okay
15/04/2024, 18:09 - Ngoni: Yeah probably
16/04/2024, 15:21 - Ngoni: Yo
16/04/2024, 15:22 - Ngoni: When you went to deposit money at the bank, was the deposit machine inside or outside?
16/04/2024, 15:30 - Rufaro: at the bank it was just inside in the foyer like place.
16/04/2024, 15:30 - Rufaro: It is besides the spot were the ATM is like to the right that is if you want to use the same bank that i went to which was i think in nelson mandela street
16/04/2024, 18:42 - Ngoni: OK thanks
16/04/2024, 18:43 - Ngoni: Did you listen to the story I shared in the group?
16/04/2024, 18:43 - Rufaro: You mean the baboon guy
16/04/2024, 18:44 - Ngoni: Yeah
16/04/2024, 18:44 - Rufaro: Didn't finish it where did you get the audio man 🤣🤣🤣
16/04/2024, 18:49 - Rufaro: Okay finished it now that is the worst way of getting robbed I can think of
16/04/2024, 18:49 - Rufaro: I mean I think being robbed at gunpoint is better to be honest
16/04/2024, 18:54 - Ngoni: 27 dollars 😂😂
16/04/2024, 18:55 - Ngoni: Guy was robbed
16/04/2024, 18:55 - Ngoni: Imagine those guys going to beitbridge😂😂
16/04/2024, 18:55 - Rufaro: You couldn't even get mad cause what if you said "ndakupai mari wangu and then it starts barking at you
16/04/2024, 18:56 - Rufaro: I can hardly think how that would end did they not alight with this dude though
16/04/2024, 18:56 - Ngoni: The fact that it was talking manje😂
16/04/2024, 19:00 - Rufaro: Well all kinds of things happen in this country after all
19/04/2024, 08:20 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
19/04/2024, 08:26 - Ngoni: Didn't I tell you it was fake?
19/04/2024, 08:26 - Ngoni: Oh I hadn't told you yet
19/04/2024, 08:26 - Ngoni: I figured it out all the way
19/04/2024, 08:26 - Rufaro: Oh how did you find out I though you said it sounded like a good deal
19/04/2024, 08:27 - Ngoni: They basically are aiming at stealing steal your money through the 'transport' fee
19/04/2024, 08:28 - Rufaro: What ???  Thieves are becoming more and more creative nowadays aren't they
19/04/2024, 08:28 - Ngoni: So this is how I figured it out, they will post a car, but if you do an image search of the car you will realize that they are stealing images from other accounts, I found one of the cars on an Instagram page of a company called high class car sales. The image was from 2022
19/04/2024, 08:29 - Ngoni: They take the image, and tell you they have the car, they don't. It's all fake
19/04/2024, 08:29 - Ngoni: The other thing that gave them aways was the pricing. A new Toyota aqua cost 7k to 8k
19/04/2024, 08:30 - Ngoni: They would sell it for 5k
19/04/2024, 08:30 - Rufaro: But won't you end up having to rent a car though so how will it go if you try to rent a car they do not have
19/04/2024, 08:30 - Ngoni: That's impossible
19/04/2024, 08:31 - Rufaro: That mean the car is second had or simply some other fake brand like a Tayota like how the awesome store from gumball had a TV called soppy
19/04/2024, 08:31 - Ngoni: And finally, I noticed that they posted a car they had claimed to have sold before. So their group has disappearing text but I was sure they posted the car twice. How is that possible when they had sold the car
19/04/2024, 08:32 - Ngoni: They are in Beitbridge. So they say they will deliver the car to you after you have paid the transport fee, the question is, will they really?
19/04/2024, 08:32 - Rufaro: Hmmm that is like some desperate type of marketing to get some form of income from scamming people
19/04/2024, 08:33 - Rufaro: You remind me of the furniture delivery service that would scam people out of their money by accepting money and never actually delivering the furniture
19/04/2024, 08:34 - Ngoni: No no no, even if it's second hand. Dude, a second hand car with a mileage of 70000 km is basically brand new. Those cars are they ones sold for 8000. The same car if it were really brand new it would sell for about 10000
19/04/2024, 08:35 - Rufaro: Damn like people out here thinking of creative ways to steal what they actual he'll man
19/04/2024, 08:35 - Rufaro: That is all kinds of wrong
19/04/2024, 08:36 - Ngoni: I can assure you, they do not have the cars they claim to have. It's simply not possible
19/04/2024, 08:37 - Ngoni: Maybe they do have cars, but the ones they are saying are available for renting, those cars don't exist, they are stolen pictures
19/04/2024, 08:38 - Rufaro: Damn do they then require you to give them money first before they give you a car
19/04/2024, 08:38 - Ngoni: One other thing is, if they really were giving people these cars, how come they have never posted it? Lots of car dealers will ask if they can take a picture of you and your new car to put on their page, these guys don't have a single one. So the question is to whom are they selling? It's all fake <This message was edited>
19/04/2024, 10:04 - Rufaro: What The Hell(Imagine in Steven he accent from "emotional damage accent") this another type of scam what is wrong with them anyway
19/04/2024, 17:18 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
20/04/2024, 17:55 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
20/04/2024, 17:56 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
20/04/2024, 18:02 - Ngoni: Asi there's a lot of unrealistic expectations?
20/04/2024, 18:42 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
21/04/2024, 12:01 - Rufaro: Yo wassup
21/04/2024, 12:02 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
21/04/2024, 12:24 - Ngoni: Yo
21/04/2024, 12:24 - Ngoni: Let me try to finish it
21/04/2024, 12:25 - Rufaro: Okay sure
21/04/2024, 12:26 - Rufaro: Have you ever written a methodology for a research before
21/04/2024, 12:26 - Ngoni: Yeah
21/04/2024, 12:27 - Ngoni: Final year
21/04/2024, 12:32 - Rufaro: Is the methodology like a list of steps I followed or instructions that others can follow if they want to replicate my research
21/04/2024, 12:35 - Ngoni: It's the techniques you're using in the process of creating whatever you're creating
21/04/2024, 12:36 - Ngoni: Like how did you create your dataset
21/04/2024, 12:36 - Ngoni: How did you clean it
21/04/2024, 12:36 - Ngoni: How did you analyze and train etc
21/04/2024, 12:36 - Rufaro: Oh I see
21/04/2024, 12:36 - Rufaro: Okay thanks
21/04/2024, 13:02 - Rufaro: Also if you could get your hands on your methodology could you give it to me
21/04/2024, 19:18 - Rufaro: Yo Did you manage to finish the movie
21/04/2024, 20:28 - Ngoni: Hmm, I'll look to see if I still have it
21/04/2024, 20:28 - Ngoni: Nope, not yet
21/04/2024, 20:28 - Rufaro: Oh okay not a problem then
21/04/2024, 20:29 - Rufaro: So lately today I was watching this YouTube channel called.lostreak.chicken and I realised that this university education system is too overwhelming
21/04/2024, 20:30 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
21/04/2024, 20:39 - Ngoni: Hmm, I see. The traveling is obviously a hustle and takes a lot of time. So when it comes to studying, you could do it a little different. Sometimes when you have time you can do the studying at work, that way, you won't need to pressure yourself to do it when you get home. That's only if it's possible at work.
21/04/2024, 20:41 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
21/04/2024, 20:40 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
21/04/2024, 20:45 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
21/04/2024, 21:19 - Ngoni: Just focus on your work man. If they say you're easily replaced then it might not be worth to fight over opinions even though you have a better solution
21/04/2024, 21:19 - Ngoni: Ego is a thing in these companies and some people just want to do the bare minimum to get along
21/04/2024, 21:27 - Rufaro: Exactly like I see this resulting in mass retirements where the thing is this is what cbz wants to a certain extent cause of the merger with zb Bank but I believe the rate of resignations will be more than the bank can handle cause I made an application that merges excel files and can be used to collect certain data for my workmate imagine he resigns I finish attachment and someone else comes wanting to do the same task as him they might not even know the application exists and even if they do they may not know how to get it either
22/04/2024, 10:28 - Ngoni: They are a big business, they'll probably know how to take care of it. All you can do is focus on you and mind your own business coz, it'll be stressful otherwise. I say don't even listen to those that want to resign, they want others to do the same as them but remember you're not the same. So set your own goals, let them resign, for you it's just attachment, you're doing it for your grade, and for connections to the bank.
23/04/2024, 13:04 - Rufaro: yo wassup how are you doin g
25/04/2024, 12:40 - Rufaro: Good afternoon how are you doing i am good here learning more and more on machine learning and will likely be able to make my project successfully i am hoping.
26/04/2024, 12:33 - Ngoni: Hey hey
26/04/2024, 12:33 - Ngoni: That's dope
26/04/2024, 12:34 - Ngoni: What have you leant so far?
26/04/2024, 13:20 - Rufaro: I learnt more on data manipulation took a 4 hour course on kaggle
26/04/2024, 13:39 - Ngoni: That's dope
26/04/2024, 13:39 - Ngoni: was it on pandas?
26/04/2024, 13:50 - Rufaro: Yeah pandas
26/04/2024, 13:51 - Rufaro: The guys here also lecturing me on model perfomance training prerequisites and more so soon I will have a model ready and set for use
26/04/2024, 14:01 - Rufaro: Gone for etiquette training today they be making some of our clothing choices difficult think I may have to go shopping for new clothes later
26/04/2024, 14:10 - Ngoni: OK so that's good
26/04/2024, 14:10 - Ngoni: You will have to, what do they suggest you should wear?
26/04/2024, 14:11 - Rufaro: Yeah I am still trying to find a direction on how my model will tackle the problem and what kind of data I will transform
26/04/2024, 14:11 - Rufaro: Yeah but this broke nigga don't like formal wear and you know it
26/04/2024, 14:18 - Ngoni: Oh I see
26/04/2024, 14:18 - Ngoni: How formal are they talking about? Is could actually be cheap
26/04/2024, 18:12 - Rufaro: Business formal, semi formal or smart casual
26/04/2024, 18:22 - Ngoni: Oh I see
26/04/2024, 18:23 - Ngoni: You can get some nice formal-ish shoes for 25
26/04/2024, 18:23 - Ngoni: Then shirts for 10 bucks and chinos for 10 to 12
27/04/2024, 11:39 - Rufaro: Okay I will try and look for some at the shops later
27/04/2024, 11:40 - Rufaro: Good morning anyways did you hear about Rutendo
27/04/2024, 11:46 - Ngoni: Nope
27/04/2024, 11:46 - Ngoni: What happened?
27/04/2024, 11:47 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
27/04/2024, 19:11 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
27/04/2024, 19:20 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
27/04/2024, 19:57 - Ngoni: Baby clothes
27/04/2024, 19:58 - Ngoni: You can't go wrong with those
27/04/2024, 20:45 - Rufaro: I will get her baby boots then maybe pampers
28/04/2024, 16:56 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
28/04/2024, 18:34 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
28/04/2024, 19:00 - Ngoni: That's great. But did she really call her Rufaro?
28/04/2024, 19:01 - Ngoni: Oh, finally. What will you be crunching bro?
28/04/2024, 19:01 - Rufaro: Don't know
28/04/2024, 19:02 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
28/04/2024, 19:23 - Ngoni: Why would they be turning it off?
28/04/2024, 19:23 - Ngoni: Interesting
28/04/2024, 19:24 - Rufaro: I am not sure there but will probably find out later
28/04/2024, 19:25 - Rufaro: So this side water is almost out and we going back to bahai while planning our way forward whether to blast the stone under the well or to dig a deeper borehole
28/04/2024, 19:26 - Rufaro: Borehole will cost a bargain minimum of 500 dollars so hoping to blast the well for something like 50 dollars if possible
28/04/2024, 19:34 - Ngoni: Back to what?
28/04/2024, 19:35 - Ngoni: Sounds like even tho the borehole is expensive, it might be a better option in the long run, but getting the money tho
28/04/2024, 19:37 - Rufaro: Oh we buy water from bahai monthly
28/04/2024, 19:37 - Rufaro: We pay for 2 dollars to get four buckets worth of water everyday
28/04/2024, 19:38 - Ngoni: Two dollars per month?
28/04/2024, 20:15 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
28/04/2024, 20:19 - Ngoni: Oh I see
28/04/2024, 20:45 - Rufaro: Yeah the borehole only works when there is electricity though so problem is that the power cuts result in no water for some periods of time
28/04/2024, 20:48 - Ngoni: That would suck big time
28/04/2024, 20:51 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
29/04/2024, 13:49 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
29/04/2024, 13:49 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
29/04/2024, 18:17 - Ngoni: Progress man💪
30/04/2024, 11:27 - Rufaro: yo the new currency is out
30/04/2024, 11:27 - Rufaro: the notes and coins i mean
30/04/2024, 11:35 - Rufaro: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-R6JG6TTGeNC7R59rbsBblX45MtCDizVwvbcMK061CzTGgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
30/04/2024, 11:35 - Rufaro: can you check out this form i made do you think that withit i can collect sufficient text data for my machine learning algorithm to make predictions with the data it has
30/04/2024, 19:19 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
30/04/2024, 19:19 - Rufaro: Feedback on what it feels like to be assessed by my UZ supervisor
30/04/2024, 19:23 - Ngoni: Do you have it?
30/04/2024, 19:23 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
30/04/2024, 19:24 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
30/04/2024, 19:26 - Rufaro: That was a mistake igno
30/04/2024, 19:26 - Rufaro: Ignore that one
30/04/2024, 19:27 - Ngoni: Depends on how much data you want, the struggle is gonna be getting people to fill in with enough data, coz your questions require long answers
30/04/2024, 19:27 - Rufaro: I want to see how much text data I can gather from people and if it would be enough
30/04/2024, 19:27 - Rufaro: I thought so but that is the whole point I will continue to search for data on kaggle though
30/04/2024, 19:27 - Ngoni: Yo😂😂
30/04/2024, 19:28 - Ngoni: Oh I see
30/04/2024, 19:28 - Rufaro: I have made peace with the possibility of failure already so yep there is that
30/04/2024, 19:29 - Ngoni: You can even go as far as mining tweets for text, so that you have a larger dataset
30/04/2024, 19:29 - Ngoni: Just try your best
30/04/2024, 19:29 - Rufaro: That is actually a good idea thanks I could use that
03/05/2024, 16:21 - Rufaro: Yo how are you doing
03/05/2024, 16:57 - Ngoni: How's it
03/05/2024, 16:57 - Ngoni: I'm alright
03/05/2024, 17:46 - Rufaro: I am good my models are getting better and I have decided to build hierarchical models
03/05/2024, 17:47 - Rufaro: I should have a working prototype by maybe month end if all goes well and I also get good training resources
03/05/2024, 17:47 - Rufaro: I want to ask my friends for some of their WhatsApp chats of course so I can have the models learn
03/05/2024, 17:48 - Rufaro: Also have I was told Rutendo's baby is called Hailey
03/05/2024, 18:03 - Ngoni: Oh that's nice
03/05/2024, 18:03 - Ngoni: Month end seems reasonable
03/05/2024, 18:03 - Ngoni: Oh okay, sounds good
03/05/2024, 18:04 - Ngoni: Oh, is she a fan of the joker or something
03/05/2024, 18:04 - Rufaro: Also watch ninja kamui my guy
03/05/2024, 18:06 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
03/05/2024, 18:13 - Rufaro: Yeah I liked that part to though the robot part is a turn of for a number of fans
03/05/2024, 18:14 - Rufaro: The deaths are awesome it's like animation studios have a hard time nowadays mixing fast paced action, visibility and choreography so ninja kamui was refreshing for me
03/05/2024, 19:39 - Ngoni: <Media omitted>
03/05/2024, 19:56 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
03/05/2024, 19:58 - Ngoni: Oh, so he's pretty good
03/05/2024, 19:58 - Ngoni: Coz it definitely had the same vibe
03/05/2024, 19:58 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
03/05/2024, 20:00 - Ngoni: Almost like what happened to AOT when they introduced CGI
03/05/2024, 20:01 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
04/05/2024, 18:41 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
04/05/2024, 19:27 - Ngoni: They be training some judo😂😂
04/05/2024, 19:37 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
04/05/2024, 19:38 - Ngoni: That's a judo move bro😂😂
04/05/2024, 19:41 - Rufaro: That is what I was thinking and all this over change imagine
04/05/2024, 19:42 - Rufaro: People have become very aggressive due to hard times right now and it is becoming scary to even say good morning to your neighbour if you have not established that you are friends
04/05/2024, 20:57 - Ngoni: There's no change out there, it sucks
04/05/2024, 20:57 - Ngoni: Yeah
04/05/2024, 21:00 - Ngoni: Have you touched zig yet?
04/05/2024, 21:01 - Rufaro: No not yet the bank ran out of notes within two days of the introduction of the zig
04/05/2024, 21:02 - Rufaro: First day there was an immense queue outside the bank like ridiculously long ass queue
04/05/2024, 21:03 - Ngoni: Oh wow
04/05/2024, 21:04 - Ngoni: I have somebody who was wondering why people were queuing up
04/05/2024, 21:11 - Rufaro: Most people are paid in zig nowadays and so what that means as money changers are also being arrested is that the people will need to carry cash with them for business to work
04/05/2024, 21:11 - Rufaro: If you wanna buy groceries at home go buy with zig that is the idea
04/05/2024, 21:29 - Rufaro: Did you finish kung fu panda by the way
04/05/2024, 21:34 - Ngoni: So are people buying it also arrested?
04/05/2024, 21:34 - Ngoni: Yeah i did, not bad
04/05/2024, 21:35 - Rufaro: Yep you is money laundering cause both of you is changing the currencies
04/05/2024, 21:35 - Ngoni: Oh I see
04/05/2024, 21:35 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
04/05/2024, 21:37 - Ngoni: Exactly, the villains reason wasn't all that
04/05/2024, 21:38 - Ngoni: No depth
04/05/2024, 21:38 - Ngoni: Kai and Tai long were understandable
04/05/2024, 21:38 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
04/05/2024, 21:39 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
04/05/2024, 22:04 - Ngoni: Shen just wanted to kill people
04/05/2024, 22:05 - Ngoni: He was serious
04/05/2024, 22:05 - Ngoni: Kai and Tai Lung were mu favorite tho
04/05/2024, 22:05 - Rufaro: Yeah I almost feel the story writer for the chameleon may have been different than the guys from the other movies
04/05/2024, 22:06 - Rufaro: Tai long is legendary especially that prison break out scene
04/05/2024, 22:07 - Rufaro: Like it was well scripted and the action was fun it gave a unique perspective to dreamworks action animation with kung-fu
04/05/2024, 22:07 - Rufaro: I can tell the difference between kung-fu panda style fight scenes and other animation studio fight scenes die to it somehow
04/05/2024, 22:10 - Ngoni: That prison break was classic 🤌
04/05/2024, 22:11 - Ngoni: The thing with the other movies was you couldn't tell if Po would even be able to win
04/05/2024, 22:12 - Ngoni: The chameleon movie I felt Po would win all day
04/05/2024, 22:31 - Rufaro: True I think this was just because they wanted to wrap up the story of Po which is why they made him weaker or he decided to just let the fox be the one to defeat the chameleon
04/05/2024, 22:43 - Ngoni: So the fox is gonna be the next dragon warrior then
04/05/2024, 22:43 - Rufaro: Yep according to the movie
04/05/2024, 22:44 - Ngoni: Hmm, we still want Po tho
04/05/2024, 22:44 - Ngoni: He's still a teenager 🤷‍♂️
04/05/2024, 22:46 - Rufaro: Yeah but this is how they wanted kung-fu panda to go so the fox will probably be the new hero unless Po continues going on adventures as the master teaching his student then maybe
04/05/2024, 22:53 - Ngoni: Hmm, sounds like it'll suck
05/05/2024, 07:09 - Rufaro: I feel like it will cause the brand of kung-fu panda is built of Po

05/05/2024, 14:05 - Ngoni: Obviously I'd want my refund too
05/05/2024, 14:05 - Ngoni: What they be doing making it harder for people 🤷‍♂️
05/05/2024, 14:07 - Rufaro: I am not sure there is a lot happening in the game industry right now where a lot of the AAA game studios and companies are trying to squeeze money out the customers pockets
05/05/2024, 14:08 - Rufaro: Customers end up wanting to go with indie games that are working with lesser known and smaller studios in the end cause these studios won't play stupid games with them
05/05/2024, 15:59 - Ngoni: Indie games is the way
05/05/2024, 15:59 - Ngoni: These guys sometimes really be trying to kill people's pockets
05/05/2024, 17:51 - Rufaro: GTA is supposed to cost about $80 on release that is how bad the game industry is getting
05/05/2024, 18:52 - Rufaro: https://youtube.com/shorts/Y0nKmbLkNCY?si=xHEHA-L58125jXdA
05/05/2024, 18:52 - Rufaro: Another one check it out
05/05/2024, 19:08 - Ngoni: Metro dropped one too?😂
05/05/2024, 19:08 - Ngoni: People will buy it tho
05/05/2024, 19:34 - Rufaro: I don't know how drake gonna be sleeping tonight honesty
05/05/2024, 21:44 - Ngoni: Man needs sleeping pills
05/05/2024, 21:45 - Rufaro: Yup a lot of them but kendrick will probably drop another disstrack as an alarm for drake
05/05/2024, 21:51 - Ngoni: Probably, 5 said he still got 5 more
05/05/2024, 21:52 - Rufaro: 5 more that guy hates drakes existence damn
05/05/2024, 21:52 - Ngoni: It's basically an album at this point
05/05/2024, 21:53 - Rufaro: Yup his response to a Diss is to release an album 🤣🤣🤣
05/05/2024, 21:54 - Ngoni: Bet he's in the studio right now 😂
06/05/2024, 07:55 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
06/05/2024, 07:57 - Rufaro: Hello careful so in this in the IT staff group this notice is fake the logo is old and we send applications on LinkedIn rather than outlook most of the time, tell others
06/05/2024, 08:00 - Ngoni: And why would a big bank use outlook and not it's own domain
06/05/2024, 08:07 - Rufaro: Exactly people just might not be aware though is a problem

06/05/2024, 21:11 - Ngoni: I don't feel like finishing it now

06/05/2024, 21:57 - Ngoni: He had already picked a side, even if drake actually did the stuff, he'd never believe it
06/05/2024, 21:57 - Rufaro: Yeah I am gonna look out for kendricks next song see he drops shadaya's name in it
06/05/2024, 21:58 - Rufaro: Yep
06/05/2024, 21:59 - Ngoni: Nah, shadaya small fry
06/05/2024, 22:01 - Rufaro: Remember shadaya called J Cole a bitch for apologising to kendrick
07/05/2024, 05:45 - Ngoni: Once in a while you should come and sleep over man
07/05/2024, 05:45 - Ngoni: When you don't feel like traveling
07/05/2024, 05:51 - Rufaro: Yeah sure maybe on weekends
07/05/2024, 09:13 - Rufaro: Yo wassup
07/05/2024, 09:18 - Ngoni: Yo
07/05/2024, 09:18 - Rufaro: this morning was late to work cause i did not want to board a trip trans
07/05/2024, 09:18 - Rufaro: i am not even upset about it cause i know that it i did board that bus i would not be making it to work
07/05/2024, 09:22 - Rufaro: They wanted customers so bad they refused to allow all other buses to board as long as customers did not board their bus till they were in standing
07/05/2024, 09:30 - Rufaro: Ndazotisiya vanhu vakutoda kutanga violence with one conductor from trip trans when this other Zupco driver came by and was like i don't work with trip trans i am not gonna wait in line i got a job to do.
07/05/2024, 09:32 - Ngoni: They refused all other buses? That's crazy
07/05/2024, 09:33 - Ngoni: Yeah, he was right to do that. Why don't people like trip trans?
07/05/2024, 09:35 - Rufaro: Bro they treat you like they herding cows it is ridiculous like you could simply want to just take a sit and go home and these guys would want to stop and every bus stop to pick up passengers even when the bus is full of standing and after the bus is full they will start packing you together like laundry
07/05/2024, 09:35 - Rufaro: the worst part is they have been known to get physical if you complain and they hire too many conductors just for the point of getting physical
07/05/2024, 11:30 - Ngoni: Stopping at every bus station is the worst, you could easily take two hours for a journey that's supposed to be an hour long
07/05/2024, 11:31 - Ngoni: Hmm, sounds like some terrible business
07/05/2024, 11:31 - Ngoni: What time do you get off work?
07/05/2024, 11:31 - Rufaro: That is what ends up happening
07/05/2024, 11:31 - Rufaro: 16:30 sometimes maybe even at 16:00
07/05/2024, 11:34 - Ngoni: And i can imagine the pain of having people keep coming in when the bus is already full. You won't even be able to breathe in there
07/05/2024, 11:34 - Ngoni: Oh I see
08/05/2024, 13:58 - Rufaro: Yo how are you doing so Ano has arrived in town just giving you a heads up before he storms over to your office
08/05/2024, 13:59 - Rufaro: i couldn't keep him here with me cause there is the issue of security and just allowing strangers into the bank and he has never been to domboshava so i thought he could stay over there with you it would be fine
08/05/2024, 15:03 - Ngoni: It's okay. I already met him
08/05/2024, 15:20 - Rufaro: cool just checking to make sure nobody ends up disappearing with all the weird stuff that happens nowadays after all. Also help the dude look smart tomorrow so he be okay when he gets to campus tomorrow
08/05/2024, 15:22 - Rufaro: Today i was making a model with neural networks and it got 83% accuracy and my supervisor was like "No way this kid already working well with neural networks this fast" He checks my models notices that they are just as accurate with another shallow model that is simpler and is like "how big is your dataset"
08/05/2024, 15:23 - Rufaro: I go "its 719 rows" and he goes "yeah use neural networks only for large ammounts of data not small like that otherwise it could just cram the information you fed it " , so now i want to check what happens when i give it unseen data. will update you on my progress for this week with machine learning but it is challenging.
08/05/2024, 15:44 - Ngoni: Okay i see. Yeah he's right, it might overfit if there's small amounts of data
08/05/2024, 15:47 - Rufaro: And I was kinda happy and disappointed at the same time too 😔😔😔
08/05/2024, 15:54 - Ngoni: Why would you be disappointed exactly?
08/05/2024, 16:06 - Rufaro: i did a tutorial on another deep learning model and it got a 100% accuracy so i was like this could help me get 100% accuracy as well for other problems and it then i got the results that i got
08/05/2024, 16:06 - Rufaro: i may still have a bit of a ways to go but i will make someday or another i am sure
08/05/2024, 20:25 - Ngoni: That's machine learning man
08/05/2024, 20:25 - Ngoni: There aren't that many models with a hundred percent accuracy
08/05/2024, 20:49 - Rufaro: Yeah I understand the guys I work with be talking about making their models 99 to 90% accurate so I am gonna have to keep trying for a while I guess
08/05/2024, 20:59 - Ngoni: Yeah keep it going
08/05/2024, 20:59 - Ngoni: Anything above 90 is okay
08/05/2024, 21:08 - Rufaro: Yeah will aim for that
10/05/2024, 09:19 - Rufaro: Yo how is Ano
10/05/2024, 09:25 - Ngoni: He's coming to your place today
10/05/2024, 09:34 - Rufaro: oh is  that so what time does he want to meet in town
10/05/2024, 09:34 - Rufaro: i often get off at around 16:30
10/05/2024, 09:36 - Rufaro: also give him my jersey
10/05/2024, 09:37 - Rufaro: i don't watch soccer but a free shirt is always appreciated that is all i have to say
10/05/2024, 11:02 - Ngoni: At 4
10/05/2024, 11:02 - Ngoni: Contact him
10/05/2024, 11:03 - Ngoni: Hmm, I wonder where I put it
10/05/2024, 11:03 - Ngoni: We'll see
10/05/2024, 11:03 - Rufaro: seems like his phone is not online
10/05/2024, 15:43 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
10/05/2024, 21:13 - Rufaro: Yo got home with Ano safely
10/05/2024, 21:16 - Ngoni: Nice, what time?
10/05/2024, 21:16 - Ngoni: 99% AI
10/05/2024, 21:17 - Rufaro: 19:15
10/05/2024, 21:17 - Rufaro: Yep hehe 😜 😅 ☺️
10/05/2024, 21:23 - Ngoni: Every article I write these days is detected as 99% AI
10/05/2024, 21:24 - Rufaro: Really could be a case of the AI learning the wrong patterns
10/05/2024, 21:24 - Ngoni: If we trained AI to write like humans, should it be "99% Human"🤔
10/05/2024, 21:25 - Rufaro: No it shouldn't because AI makes minimal mistakes too few to be a human especially with how humans also make punctuation errors and have different word patterns they use that are not ideal
10/05/2024, 21:43 - Ngoni: It was trained on human data
10/05/2024, 21:44 - Rufaro: Hand picked human data as far as I am concerned takes the best from a number of us.
10/05/2024, 21:46 - Rufaro: It ends up reviewed and looked at to get the best of written language grammar and dialect that by itself would make the model far too good to be human
10/05/2024, 21:50 - Ngoni: Not really, it still can't write like the best of us because it lacks creativity
10/05/2024, 23:35 - Rufaro: Well yeah it does lack creativity however this may now be an issue of inspiration and idiolism
11/05/2024, 21:35 - Rufaro: Yo wassup
11/05/2024, 21:35 - Rufaro: Ano is saying he is gonna wait for dad on Monday in harare
11/05/2024, 21:35 - Ngoni: Oh okay
11/05/2024, 21:36 - Ngoni: That's cool too
11/05/2024, 21:36 - Rufaro: I am showing him the place around here and all
11/05/2024, 21:39 - Ngoni: You shown him the town and all?
11/05/2024, 21:52 - Rufaro: Yeah took him to the shops
13/05/2024, 15:45 - Ngoni: Yo
13/05/2024, 15:45 - Ngoni: First episode of kimetsu no yaiba is out
13/05/2024, 15:46 - Rufaro: Yeah I saw people on YouTube talking about it I just got distracted and never noticed

28/03/2024, 15:25 - Tadiwanashe Nzenze: Voice recognition?
28/03/2024, 15:26 - Rufaro: no text, voice recognition would likely be easier cause there are a lot of people who probably know how to do and have done it before
28/03/2024, 15:28 - Tadiwanashe Nzenze: Ehh, that sounds difficult
28/03/2024, 15:31 - Rufaro: My home computer might not even have enough memory to run the programs can you imagine how hard life is

07/05/2024, 12:04 - Rufaro: I am working on a machine learning project where i develop a model that uses what is known as behavioural biometrics to authenticate a user.
07/05/2024, 12:05 - Rufaro: Like how different people have different handwritings or speech patterns i want it to make predictions on the user just by looking at the text that they enter at different times. So i may end up using deep learning.
07/05/2024, 12:05 - Venant: Ohhk ohhk thats interesting mans
07/05/2024, 12:06 - Rufaro: I was suggesting that the challenge that you might face when presenting some of the projects we are doing is the way we present them. If you can publish the application then publish it if  you cannot then a suggestion is to prepare the venue with internet connection so they can see code that is running.
07/05/2024, 12:07 - Venant: Yeah l will have to publish the application
07/05/2024, 12:08 - Rufaro: it is easier to present when you publish the application cause i think it also becomes hard to actually try and have you prove you know your code by erasing lines of code and having you reenter them.
07/05/2024, 12:08 - Venant: Yeah iyoyo ndonyaya yandisiri kuda😂😂😂
07/05/2024, 12:08 - Rufaro: Just don't forget to make sure that when you do publish your code add crash handlers and exceptions so it does not crash during presentation
07/05/2024, 12:09 - Venant: Ohhk sure mans danko
