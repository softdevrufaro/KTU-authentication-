19/03/2024, 09:05 - Rufaro: Good morning sir after consulting the bank and communicating with them i have decided to instead build an AI agent for the bank that studies trends and analyses customer preferences to use to for advertising and recommending the banks products and services.
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Mr Zvakafa: Put it in writing
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Mr Zvakafa: Send it to me
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Rufaro: Okay sir let me make a quick draft for you
19/03/2024, 09:42 - Mr Zvakafa: Note time is not on your side
19/03/2024, 09:43 - Rufaro: yes sir i understand
19/03/2024, 09:44 - Mr Zvakafa: Look for a data set that can enable.training of the model of the  recomender engine
19/03/2024, 09:45 - Rufaro: Understood sir
21/03/2024, 17:00 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
25/03/2024, 09:02 - Rufaro: good morning sir i hope you saw my new proposal that i sent last week
25/03/2024, 09:50 - Mr Zvakafa: Let me look ar it
25/03/2024, 09:54 - Rufaro: Okay thank you
25/03/2024, 10:31 - Mr Zvakafa: Cab you explain to me via text or maybe audio how the chatbot will work in production
25/03/2024, 10:33 - Rufaro: Okay let me try and record an audio
25/03/2024, 10:34 - Mr Zvakafa: From all our conversations , I have received 3 ideas from you. This was the first one
25/03/2024, 10:35 - Mr Zvakafa: This was the second one that you mentioned and you said this was after consulting the bank
25/03/2024, 10:33 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
25/03/2024, 10:35 - Mr Zvakafa: Today I have received the third one
25/03/2024, 10:35 - Mr Zvakafa: This was a recommendation engine for banking products
25/03/2024, 10:36 - Mr Zvakafa: This one is securing
25/03/2024, 10:39 - Mr Zvakafa: I have seen you changing ideas. What's obvious is you want to do a project that utilize AI for your bank but you are not sure which area do you want to focus on.This complicates and hinders your progress .I am not even sure that after giving you recommendations, will you take them or you will go and find a new idea
25/03/2024, 10:40 - Rufaro: Yes sir sorry about the increase in the number of ideas. You see for the other ideas i end up running into some obstacles mostly on the legal side. regarding access to some of the banks documents. One department can encourage me to try and set up a certain system handling certain information while another department can be very uncomfortable with having to deal with me regarding that mentioned area you see so i am trying to focus more on a project that would avoid or manevuer around their policies. As i do still need support from them on these such systems.
25/03/2024, 10:44 - Rufaro: No sir , I do apologize if it does seem like i am disregarding your advice. It's just i am finding it difficult to try and justify otherwise how i can make a project unique with the environment i am in. I do not mean to offend you
25/03/2024, 10:45 - Mr Zvakafa: We have started this journey already and I am your supervisor. One of my duties is to help you craft a research topic ideal for a 3rd year student. Therefore when you meet glitches or you realize it's not feasible you communicate with me .Any change must be communicated. This is why feasibility studies are key
25/03/2024, 10:46 - Rufaro: Okay sir
25/03/2024, 10:46 - Mr Zvakafa: I am here to help you come up with a solid research idea that you can put into production in your company
25/03/2024, 10:48 - Rufaro: Okay sir
25/03/2024, 10:49 - Mr Zvakafa: It's either you integrate your solution with CBZ infrastructure or you use alternative infrastructure. Some companies won't even allow you to use their data.So you look for alternative data sets or you create alternative infrastructure. Laiter on you put it into production as per the banking regulations
25/03/2024, 10:52 - Rufaro: Okay i understand. Because this side what happened is that the Bank seems to have had a change in some of their policies which are still being communicated to the people supervising me hear and i understand that some other decisions are still in the air regarding those who are working in IT so a new policy can be announced today that could affect my project which is why i was now aiming for a project where the user optionally generates the dataset over time
25/03/2024, 10:53 - Rufaro: I want to avoid capturing any confidential data on my own and only use information that is somewhat readily available or always on display something like vocabulary and speech patterns which are if anything made public by individuals willingly especially since that is necessary for users to interact with the bank and its services
25/03/2024, 10:59 - Mr Zvakafa: If I did get you.You want to use a chatbot to capture users information(that is their user names and passwords  etc).You store the data.You train a nlp model based on this data .The model will be able  to know if this is the real user? And also you mainly want the data for data recovery
25/03/2024, 11:02 - Rufaro: Yes sir the dataset will be generated on the user regularly with each login the chatbot will try and prompt them to speak so the model learns more about them and incase they change how they speak after a while. They will be prompted regularly on each login with a pin and when the model wishes to verify who they are, it may request they write a short paragraph about anything so it compares the way they communicate to the data it has in its dataset
25/03/2024, 11:03 - Rufaro: *I mean each time after they login with a pin they will be prompted to communicate with the chatbot.
25/03/2024, 11:06 - Rufaro: It won't demand the user write whole essays but just short paragraphs of maybe even 50 to 100 words or more if the user wishes to enter more information. this data will accumulate in a data set where an algorithm will study the speech patterns and register that pattern under the user of that account. similarities to that pattern will be analyzed when it comes verfication of a user
25/03/2024, 11:33 - Mr Zvakafa: So you are focusing on both speech and text
25/03/2024, 11:35 - Mr Zvakafa: I don't know wether you will build good data pipelines that will collect the data in real time
25/03/2024, 11:35 - Mr Zvakafa: Data pipelines will be critical
25/03/2024, 11:35 - Rufaro: Yes speech and text i want to make it applicable to even situations where users do not have the ability to enter audio or text input
25/03/2024, 11:37 - Mr Zvakafa: Focus on situation. It's good to be ambitious but narrow your scope and know your target group
25/03/2024, 11:38 - Rufaro: Okay sir i will try my best then. How about i will focus on text first then move on to speech after text pattern recognition is successful
25/03/2024, 11:41 - Mr Zvakafa: That's why I have said  try to focus on one thing rather than both speech and text
25/03/2024, 11:42 - Mr Zvakafa: You will need to build data pipelines that collect all this big data
25/03/2024, 11:42 - Mr Zvakafa: AI applications need more data
25/03/2024, 11:43 - Mr Zvakafa: You collect the data , and the data must be appropriate with the machine learning model you are using
25/03/2024, 11:44 - Mr Zvakafa: Are creating your own machine learning algorithm or you are creating your own algorithm???
25/03/2024, 11:46 - Rufaro: I intend to create my own algorithm and i will be using other online algorithms for reference however if i find an algorithm that is already in use i will use that algorithm instead and will only modify it slightly
25/03/2024, 11:46 - Mr Zvakafa: The security aspect using AI must be clear as in how are you using the chatbot and the nlp model to enforce security
25/03/2024, 11:47 - Mr Zvakafa: If you are creating your own algorithm then you have to prove its accuracy benchmarking with other algorithms in existence
25/03/2024, 11:47 - Mr Zvakafa: I did not get the last objective?
25/03/2024, 11:49 - Rufaro: The model is to be used to verify the users identity like a password does on entry. The AI will try and recognize the user by comparing the text input to the text data in the dataset and will grant them access or deny it to them depending on  whether the patterns it analyzes are the same.
25/03/2024, 11:51 - Rufaro: Oh like that is were the secure part is. The Idea is that the chatbot will give a go ahead to the backend service to grant you access to the account or services you want like lets say data recovery as i mentioned. It will recognize you as the owner of the account and grant you access to said account so you can enter and maybe even change your password if you forgot it
25/03/2024, 11:54 - Mr Zvakafa: You will have these components:

 1.Website that you integrate with the web chatbot
2.Back end comprising of the data infrastructure(Data pipelines)
3. Machine learning model that you will put into production enforcing the security you are talking about
4. Good data collection will be critical because that's what affects your model. You will continuously monitor your model in production to see if the accuracy is still the same. So you first train the model using the data set you are saying you will collect(Data lake)
25/03/2024, 11:55 - Rufaro: yes sir those are the components that i will have in my project
25/03/2024, 11:56 - Mr Zvakafa: What's hhe difference between a client entering credentials using a web form and  using a web chatbot??
25/03/2024, 11:57 - Mr Zvakafa: Then your data engineering  and machine learning skills  have  to be shaperned
25/03/2024, 11:59 - Mr Zvakafa: I don't know how many CBZ cliemts are using  online web based  banking . I have been using CBZ for the last 7 years.I have never used web banking services. I prefer  the mobile app cbz touch because it does nor require data for me to bank
25/03/2024, 12:02 - Mr Zvakafa: Don't use the word aims. Coz we have one  aim 
Be specific on you aim.Dont mention functionalities of the app in the aim
25/03/2024, 12:02 - Rufaro: Okay sir noted
25/03/2024, 12:03 - Mr Zvakafa: It's not necessary when writting an academic document to mention during the time at cbz  what what
25/03/2024, 12:04 - Mr Zvakafa: At the end of this project you will produce a smart product(Web chatbot) that enforces security in the bank
25/03/2024, 12:05 - Rufaro: I want to open the possibility to tracking individuals who repeatedly try and gain access to the accounts of other users by generating a digital identity that marks users like that with a digital identity that identifies them as a threat to the banks security.
25/03/2024, 12:06 - Mr Zvakafa: So  make it clear how this solution is the best for security purposes comparing other bots like whatsapp chatbot or mobile forms like those on other existing applications like cbz touch
25/03/2024, 12:07 - Mr Zvakafa: Are you saying this  cannot be achieved through mobile.if that's so then make it clear in your do document
25/03/2024, 12:09 - Mr Zvakafa: I think i have replied you. Let me get down to business
25/03/2024, 12:10 - Rufaro: Okay sir thank you very much for your time i will do my best with your help
10/04/2024, 16:24 - Rufaro: <Media omitted>
14/04/2024, 10:22 - Mr Zvakafa: <Media omitted>
14/04/2024, 10:22 - Mr Zvakafa: In your aim how many models do you want to create??
14/04/2024, 10:23 - Mr Zvakafa: Do u have a data set to train these models
14/04/2024, 10:24 - Mr Zvakafa: What's the characteristics of your training data set
14/04/2024, 10:30 - Mr Zvakafa: To developa machine learning model that does 1.2.3 utilizing  1.2.3
14/04/2024, 10:31 - Mr Zvakafa: I have told you so many times objectives start with to  to to
14/04/2024, 10:32 - Mr Zvakafa: Objective 1 you want to create or aquire.What is it that you want to do??
14/04/2024, 10:32 - Rufaro: Okay sir sorry let me fix that
14/04/2024, 10:34 - Rufaro: I want to make use of an AWE to assess an individuals writing skills. So far I have been still trying to find out which is most ideal to use an already designed AWE or to create one from an available ML model
14/04/2024, 10:36 - Mr Zvakafa: Objective 2 is
 to collect data entered from users etc using a web application
14/04/2024, 10:36 - Rufaro: to assess writing perfomance I have the IELTs dataset provided by kaggle
14/04/2024, 10:38 - Mr Zvakafa: Make it clear whether u want to create or you want to make use of an existing AWEn
14/04/2024, 10:38 - Mr Zvakafa: This is 14 and you don't know kuti ndiri kuda kushandisa chii
14/04/2024, 10:39 - Rufaro: Yes I wish to create a simple interface similar to the one on touch where the question is on top followed by a multiline textbox. The user will answer the question in the form of two or more paragraphs then they submit their answer. I will the convert the text to a suitable format using a pipeline I will create using tools provided by sklearn then store it in a dataset
14/04/2024, 10:40 - Mr Zvakafa: Make it clear what you want to do
14/04/2024, 10:41 - Mr Zvakafa: In a nutshell rephraise for me that objective. The way I understand that objective is you want to just collect data using the web application ( ofcourse through various forms)
14/04/2024, 10:43 - Rufaro: Okay I want to collect data from the user using a Web application. The data will be text based.
14/04/2024, 10:44 - Rufaro: On submission it is added to a dataset in the backend and then processed later by the model
14/04/2024, 10:44 - Mr Zvakafa: Are u training the model online(streaming) or batch
14/04/2024, 10:45 - Mr Zvakafa: So you will train the model using the generated data
14/04/2024, 10:45 - Mr Zvakafa: ??
14/04/2024, 10:46 - Rufaro: The AWE will be trained using the IELTs data set which is batch training
14/04/2024, 10:47 - Rufaro: The second model the user predictor will use streaming
14/04/2024, 10:47 - Rufaro: I intend to control the number of users who will help train it so I can get data that is as accurate as possible
14/04/2024, 10:48 - Mr Zvakafa: Third objective make it clear  that I want to develop a machine learning model .on its own the Word model is too broad. Models utilize various techniques. In this case u are creating a machine learning model
14/04/2024, 10:50 - Mr Zvakafa: The reason why I am asking  is machine learning models  must be trained using  large   data sets so that the prediction is accurate
14/04/2024, 10:51 - Rufaro: Okay I wish to create a model that uses a DecisionTree to make predictions. The features it will look at will include the users score after AWE's assessment, the question they were answering , the length of their answer and the word order they used
14/04/2024, 10:51 - Mr Zvakafa: You must be able to differentiate whether your problem is a classification problem or regression problem  or a reinforcement problem. You must understand the problem
14/04/2024, 10:52 - Rufaro: I understand sir I will try my best to make the audience as large as possible I will try and get permission to openly stream the model as well
14/04/2024, 10:52 - Mr Zvakafa: For now I don't want features..I just neeed to know the objective
14/04/2024, 10:53 - Mr Zvakafa: What performance measure will use on the model??
14/04/2024, 10:54 - Rufaro: Okay sir I wish to use a Classifier model
14/04/2024, 10:56 - Rufaro: I wish to use an accuracy score. The model will compare how close it predictions are to the dataset
14/04/2024, 10:58 - Mr Zvakafa: In an objective you just tell us the objective as it is . 

Example

To create a machine leaning model utilizing  supports vector machine to predict 1.2.3 things 

You objective must be measurable. Be specific
14/04/2024, 10:58 - Mr Zvakafa: Research more on the performance measure
14/04/2024, 10:58 - Rufaro: Okay sir
14/04/2024, 11:00 - Mr Zvakafa: Make your aim understandable. Make it clear so that the reader don't find problems in understanding it
14/04/2024, 11:00 - Rufaro: My objective is 

To create a machine learning model that utilises decision tree classifiers to predict the likelihood of the user being the intended client of the account
14/04/2024, 11:01 - Mr Zvakafa: On the last part of the objective you can add a part on how you wil solve that problem in context
14/04/2024, 11:01 - Mr Zvakafa: That's more understandable  now
14/04/2024, 11:02 - Rufaro: Noted sir
14/04/2024, 11:02 - Mr Zvakafa: List your objectives in  chronological order
14/04/2024, 11:02 - Mr Zvakafa: Know what starts first
14/04/2024, 11:03 - Mr Zvakafa: The AWE feeds into the data pipeline
14/04/2024, 11:04 - Rufaro: Noted
14/04/2024, 11:04 - Rufaro: Yes the AWE will also feed its output into the data pipeline as well
14/04/2024, 11:04 - Mr Zvakafa: A data pipeline is just  data processing infrastructure that takes data form various sources  .in the context of the bank you might need data coming from various sources
