20, Anotida nzenze, The problem is whether Goku can touch gojo or not that is the issue
21, Rufaro, Let me tell you one thing goku can destroy the planet and survive
22, Rufaro, Also gojo gets tired and goku doesn't if gojo uses domain expansion goku uses instant transmission to run away out the domain come back and slap the guy
23, Anotida nzenze, But he can't touch gojo so gojo will sit and do nothing
24, Anotida nzenze, But patournament of power Goku became tired
25, Rufaro, There is a technique that was used before in dragonballz by vegeta on captain ginyu that made him explode I haven't confirmed but heard goku can also use it

90, Sarah," We are concerned about the science behind the the alerts. The technology behind. Whatever that you wil use must no be so shallow since you are a part 3 student.Sending an alert is not a problem,  but coming up with an algorithm/or whatever you can call it  that can learn  that environment in real time and predict in realtime and send an alert that we need urgent maintainance and attention. If it's real time monitoring I will be ok with it"

95, Rufaro, you see the problem for me personally is that at the end of the day sir was no longer really pleased by how i continued to to change projects with his criticism and each session we had when he mentioned whether or not h
96, Rufaro, *whether or not that we would listen if he spoke to us there is a possibility that he meant me which is why i have decided that to stick to my current project but i will just have to make changes that he approves of i am hoping something will turn out well but pakatoipa even at my end as well. so tongoshingirira

400, +263 77 352 0030, Thanks😇😇🔥
401, +263 71 944 6004, <Media omitted>
402, +263 71 944 6004, Tonight we are going to talk about
403, +263 71 944 6004, First we have to understand what creativity is
404, +263 71 944 6004, And the best definition of creativity
405, +263 71 944 6004, God gave each of us talents and creative minds
406, +263 71 944 6004," The first verse in the Bible says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and earth”"
407, +263 71 944 6004, God is Creator
408, +263 71 944 6004, Therefore the power to create is in us all
409, +263 71 944 6004, Each of us is not just a precious creation of God
410, +263 71 944 6004, We have ability to use our light to create in every area of our lives
411, +263 71 944 6004, So out of light God created us and placed us in the Garden of Eden on earth which was also created out of light
412, +263 71 944 6004, So we are called to create something out of what already exists
413, +263 71 944 6004, Creating new ideas for his kingdom
414, +263 71 944 6004, In Ephesians 2:10
415, +263 71 944 6004: In Ephesians 2,10
416, +263 71 944 6004," ”For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.“"
417, +263 71 944 6004, We often think about creativity only in terms of arts etc
418, +263 71 944 6004, But creativity is so much more than that
419, +263 71 944 6004, And we will be producing light
420, +263 71 944 6004, The light which comes from creativity
421, +263 71 944 6004, So seeing God in a more creative light invites us to hear and move freely to the creativeness of the gospel
422, +263 71 944 6004, We notice that the closer people got to Jesus
423, +263 71 944 6004, Peter did not try walking on water
424, +263 71 944 6004, Martha had not wondered about her brother coming back from the dead
425, +263 78 866 0500, Amen
426, +263 71 944 6004, There was no following Jesus without taking in and taking on the wild and wonderful possibilities he inspired day in and day out
427, +263 71 944 6004, The good news is that being in Christ makes us not only new creations but also new creators
428, +263 71 944 6004, Because he gives you the Light
429, +263 77 442 6999, Amen
430, +263 71 944 6004, Did you know you are called by God to be creative?
431, +263 71 944 6004, So tonight I have come to encourage someone to be creative
432, +263 71 944 6004, Because it produces light
433, +263 71 944 6004, This is a season of Light
434, +263 77 402 5094, Following
435, +263 71 944 6004, Don’t sit on your light
436, +263 77 402 5094, *LIGHT*
437, +263 71 944 6004, Make it shine
438, +263 77 402 5094, These are nuggets
439, +263 71 944 6004, Be creative
440, +263 71 944 6004, Invest in the things of the kingdom for the production of your light and creativity
441, +263 71 944 6004, The Bible says
442, +263 71 944 6004, There’s something about this light
443, +263 71 944 6004, God created the earth without the light of the sun because he didn’t need light he is the light
444, +263 71 944 6004, And so are you
445, +263 71 944 6004, Don’t wait for something extraordinary to come
446, +263 71 944 6004, Your light is already bright
447, +263 71 944 6004, This is a different type of light
448, +263 77 442 6999, Amen
449, +263 71 944 6004, Good night
450, +263 77 442 6999, Goodnight thank you for this wonderful words of God ❤️

560, +263 77 990 0946, Both
561, +263 71 142 4091, day you die
562, +263 78 001 7053, Why?
563, +263 78 001 7053, Why?
564, +263 71 142 4091, because in ecclesiastes chapter 7 it says the day you die is better than the day you were born
565, +263 71 142 4091, its because the day you die becomes the trademark of your nextlife........
566, +263 78 669 9867, Day you die
567, +263 71 799 8739, Everyday

1131, +263 77 300 6134, And one of the ways we learnt was how his shadow comes first before his arrival
1132, +263 77 300 6134, Some of the darkness you go through is a preparation for the arrival of God in your life
1133, +263 77 300 6134, So you have to be able to see
1134, +263 77 300 6134, When God arrives he shakes that which was already existing
1135, +263 77 538 8573, I agree a day started in the evening not in the morning Saka hmmm
1136, +263 77 300 6134, He comes and makes room for Himself
1137, +263 77 300 6134, So whatever you are going through

1143, +263 78 346 1988, Ini i say so  coz God didn't tell us if he started on Monday or Friday or any of those dates since they were man crafted ..so we cant pin point the exact date he started creation according to the days of the week . henceforth we can say u can choose your own date to set it as a Sabbath how ever a certain church made sartuday as their day and enforced the norm.to everyone which is not wrong so ur Sabbath can be Monday or Friday or Wednesday ..
1144, +263 78 346 1988, Its not that date that matter it's the amount of heart and spirit you put into the date to honour God
1145, +263 71 944 6004, <Media omitted>
1146, +263 71 944 6004, I hope I find you well 😊
1147, +263 78 346 1988, My pastor is typing ..
1148, +263 71 944 6004, Today I will share a short teaching about Grace
1149, +263 71 944 6004, And I’m in the book of Genesis chapter 20
1150, +263 71 944 6004, The Story we have probably heard a couple of times
1151, +263 71 944 6004, The story of Abraham
1152, +263 71 944 6004, When he decieves Abimelech
1153, +263 71 944 6004, So today I learnt something in the morning about Grace and Saint Hennessy gave me the opportunity to teach tonight and Id like to share the word with you all ❤️
1154, +263 71 944 6004," ”Abraham introduced his wife, Sarah, by saying, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for Sarah and had her brought to him at his palace.“"
1155, +263 71 944 6004," ”But that night God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are a dead man, for that woman you have taken is already married!”“"
1156, +263 71 944 6004," ”But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?“"
1157, +263 71 944 6004," ”Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘Yes, he is my brother.’ I acted in complete innocence! My hands are clean.” In the dream God responded, “Yes, I know you are innocent. That’s why I kept you from sinning against me, and why I did not let you touch her.“"
1158, +263 71 944 6004," ”Now return the woman to her husband, and he will pray for you, for he is a prophet. Then you will live. But if you don’t return her to him, you can be sure that you and all your people will die.”“"
1159, +263 71 944 6004, So my message is coming from these scriptures
1160, +263 71 944 6004, Abimelech said to God I did this in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands
1161, +263 71 944 6004, And he said this because he hadn’t slept with Sarah
1162, +263 71 944 6004, And the Lord responded to him saying
1163, +263 71 944 6004, But when it comes to the action of not doing wrong
1164, +263 71 944 6004, He kept him from sinning
1165, +263 71 944 6004, He was saying yes you were decieved
1166, +263 71 944 6004, But when it comes to you not sleeping with her
1167, +263 71 944 6004, He made him not sleep with her
1168, +263 71 944 6004," ”Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.“"
1169, +263 71 944 6004, God is able to keep you blameless
1170, +263 71 944 6004, When it comes to being righteous
1171, +263 71 944 6004, It is something that you are made
1172, +263 71 944 6004, God showed this through Abraham and Abimelech
1173, +263 71 944 6004, The Lord doesn’t want us to be moving as if we are being righteous in our own ways
1174, +263 71 944 6004, He makes us righteous
1175, +263 71 944 6004, The Lord was angry at Abimelech because he said
1176, +263 71 944 6004, He was now thinking he is an innocent nation
1177, +263 71 944 6004, Yet the Lord made him innocent for the sake of Abraham
1178, +263 71 944 6004, That kind of mindset
1179, +263 71 944 6004, When we look at ourselves higher than what God has made us
1180, +263 71 944 6004, We might say
1181, +263 71 944 6004, I am the one keeping you from doing those sins
1182, +263 71 944 6004, So we must stay humble enough to acknowledge that the Lord is making us righteous not our own works or ability
1183, +263 71 944 6004, God is saying don’t boast to me
1184, +263 71 944 6004, And Abraham also had committed a sin
1185, +263 71 944 6004, He lied
1186, +263 71 944 6004, But even at that time God was with him protecting him
1187, +263 71 944 6004, He did things out of fear
1188, +263 71 944 6004, Yet in that moment the Lord made him a prophet
1189, +263 71 944 6004, Before that we had no record of Abraham being a prophet
1190, +263 71 944 6004, So even when you are wrong
1191, +263 71 944 6004, The Lord is gracious
1192, +263 71 944 6004, Even when you are not in the right position
1193, +263 71 944 6004, I’m not encouraging you to do wrong 😂
1194, +263 71 944 6004, But There is no part of Christian true living that is earned
1195, +263 71 944 6004, It is given to us by the Holy Spirit
1196, +263 71 944 6004, We are made righteous because God makes us righteous
1197, +263 71 944 6004, We are made Holy because God calls us Holy
1198, +263 71 944 6004, Abraham became a prophet because God named him a prophet
1199, +263 71 944 6004, After that we see him operating as a Prophet
1200, +263 71 944 6004, Showing that God is the one who makes us
1201, +263 71 944 6004, Our Father has named each and every one of us and called us to be something
1202, +263 71 944 6004, And by his grace we shall become what he has said like Abraham
1203, +263 71 944 6004, Good night

1284, +263 71 142 4091, Good evening my pastor❤️
1285, +263 78 258 5433, Good evening  ma❤️
1286, +263 71 944 6004, Tonight I’m going to teach about
1287, +263 71 944 6004, This is our anchor scripture
1288, +263 78 258 5433, Ready🗒️
1289, +263 71 944 6004, The scripture is talking about Abraham
1290, +263 78 669 9867, Powerful
1291, +263 71 944 6004, It says Abraham staggered not at the promise
1292, +263 71 944 6004, To *stagger* is to move unsteadily as if about to fall
1293, +263 71 944 6004, The scripture says Abraham did not move unsteadily Abraham did not fall  at the promise
1294, +263 78 258 5433, Yessssss🔥📌
1295, +263 71 944 6004, You might be like me when I first read the scripture I was like how
1296, +263 71 944 6004, Because there’s an entire tribe from Ishmael from his fall he chose Hagar to give him a child since Sarah was barren
1297, +263 71 944 6004, And Abraham out of fear lied that Sarah was his sister to Kung Abimelech
1298, +263 71 944 6004, He questioned God he made his own solutions
1299, +263 71 944 6004, But when the Bible recorded about him
1300, +263 71 944 6004, The Bible said he staggered not
1301, +263 78 258 5433, 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1302, +263 71 944 6004, Yet there’s people like Esau who made 1 mistake but the Bible calls him an infidel
1303, +263 71 944 6004, In the New Testament
1304, +263 78 258 5433, 🙆🏽‍♀️🔥
1305, +263 71 944 6004," An infidel is ""unfaithful"" a person who is accused of disbelief in their beliefs"
1306, +263 71 944 6004, But Abraham hanzi he staggered not
1307, +263 71 944 6004, I was like Lord
1308, +263 71 944 6004, But because when God defines
1309, +263 78 669 9867, Teach 🔥
1310, +263 71 944 6004, He defines you by what he has made you to be
1311, +263 71 944 6004, Holiness is not something you achieve
1312, +263 71 944 6004, Holiness is what you are made
1313, +263 78 342 0350, Yes🙏
1314, +263 71 944 6004, ”And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy and complete for all time!“
1315, +263 71 944 6004, He made us perfectly holy
1316, +263 71 944 6004, It’s what he calls us
1317, +263 71 944 6004, Abraham though he staggered in the Old Testament
1318, +263 71 944 6004, But because he trusted God enough to make the line of Jesus
1319, +263 71 944 6004, He was going to be defined after Jesus
1320, +263 71 348 5628, <Media omitted>
1321, +263 71 944 6004, No matter what you’ve done in the past
1322, +263 71 944 6004, No matter what you’re struggling with
1323, +263 78 258 5433, Ouuuuuuuuu🥵✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽
1324, +263 71 944 6004, When God is going to talk about you
1325, +263 71 944 6004, It will be
1326, +263 78 258 5433, My Godddddd🥵🥵🥵
1327, +263 71 944 6004, And youll even be shocked yourself that what is Jesus saying does he know me
1328, +263 71 944 6004, But because you believed in him
1329, +263 71 944 6004, Though you never saw the actual cross he died on
1330, +263 71 944 6004, Jesus celebrates your
1331, +263 71 944 6004, I want someone to pray that the Lord helps them
1332, +263 71 944 6004, To see themselves the way he sees them
1333, +263 71 944 6004, Because if you see yourself from God’s perspective
1334, +263 71 944 6004, Religion will irritate you
1335, +263 71 944 6004, Religion calls you by your weaknesses
1336, +263 71 944 6004, And it identifies you by your weaknesses
1337, +263 71 348 5628, <Media omitted>
1338, +263 71 944 6004, But Jesus calls you as
1339, +263 71 944 6004, Even though you’ve made mistakes
1340, +263 78 669 9867, 🔥
1341, +263 71 944 6004, Abraham staggered but because he was what God said he is
1342, +263 71 944 6004, He was perfect to God
1343, +263 71 944 6004, Only a Father can name a child
1344, +263 71 944 6004, Your Father has called you righteous
1345, +263 78 258 5433, This word is for me ✋🏽
1346, +263 71 944 6004, He rose from the dead for you
1347, +263 71 944 6004, He sanctified you
1348, +263 71 944 6004, You have his DNA
1349, +263 71 944 6004, You are what your father says you are
1350, +263 78 669 9867, 🔥
1351, +263 71 944 6004, It’s high time you believe what he says
1352, +263 71 944 6004, It’s time you believe what he has done for you
1353, +263 71 944 6004, Rest in it
1354, +263 71 944 6004, Good night
1355, +263 78 258 5433, Louderrrrrr🔥🔥🔥

1392, +263 78 001 7053, There are levels  in
1393, +263 78 001 7053, In trying  to find  meaning  in the Bible  there's  what is called  the Law of first mention
1394, +263 78 001 7053, The Word  worship  was first employed in Genesis  22 vs 25
1395, +263 78 001 7053, The  Word was used when Abraham  was selfless  to go and sacrifice  his own Son Issac  as a sign of Obedience  to God
1396, +263 78 001 7053, Thus  being  said  we can establish  that worship is beyond  singing
1397, +263 78 001 7053, The Bible  then makes  it clear  to us
1398, +263 78 001 7053, What God  desires  most

1518, +263 78 001 7053, A court
1519, +263 78 001 7053, A court
1520, +263 78 001 7053, It just depends  on the

1523, +263 78 026 5054, 🤣🤣🤣
1524, +263 78 001 7053, If we visit  the book  of Acts 4
1525, +263 78 001 7053, There was a physical  court

1527, +263 78 001 7053, Wrong  answers  only
1528, Rufaro, Spiritual at least I have no need to make up a story to prove my innocence and I can be exonerated out of the most bizarre scenarios without a lawyer
1529, +263 78 001 7053, Alright

1537, +263 78 001 7053, So when  Peter  healed
1538, +263 78 001 7053, And the major  reason  of the court  session  was
1539, +263 78 001 7053, Acts 4 vs 7
1540, +263 78 001 7053, Peter then responded  in 4 vs 10
1541, +263 78 258 5433, Following 📌
1542, +263 78 001 7053, The Judges were not  pleased  with answer
1543, +263 78 001 7053, But the most unfortunate  part for them
1544, +263 78 001 7053, Hence these men could  not be put in prison
1545, +263 78 001 7053, The incident only  increased
1546, +263 78 001 7053, It made them
1547, +263 78 001 7053, It totally  changed  their lives
1548, +263 78 001 7053, Before  the court session
1549, +263 78 001 7053, Acts 3 vs 6
1550, +263 78 001 7053, But after  a successful  day in court
1551, +263 78 001 7053, To bring  to the feet
1552, +263 78 001 7053, Acts 4 vs 37
1553, +263 78 001 7053, Life has given  you
1554, +263 78 258 5433, True

1576, +263 78 001 7053, And
1577, +263 78 001 7053, They came with the reward of honor  on his feet
1578, +263 78 001 7053, A lot might  have  been taken away from you
1579, +263 78 001 7053, But the Spirit  in you
1580, +263 78 001 7053, And that spirit
1581, +263 78 001 7053, A court case was made for Abraham  when a king  took his wife
1582, +263 78 001 7053, The Lord will represent  you
1583, +263 78 001 7053, The lord will energize  you to stand

1973, +263 78 001 7053, But it also patterns  to working  for God through  various  means

2013, +263 78 092 3087, 🖐️
2014, +263 78 849 1118, 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Yesssssss
2015, +263 77 891 7712, 🖐
2016, +263 77 454 8584," So most times, we have areas in our lives where we really want God's help"
2017, +263 78 721 0133," Yes, marinate and fry us 😊❤️"
2018, +263 77 454 8584, Then again we look at God's words in the bible and he will be saying
2019, +263 77 454 8584, We look at our lives and we thing haa maybe God doesn't really love me
2020, +263 78 849 1118," True, sometimes it feels like it😭😭😭"
2021, +263 77 461 9483, 🔥🔥🔥ouwwww beautiful
2022, +263 77 454 8584, Today I want us for talk about this verse
2023, +263 71 657 1422, <Media omitted>
2024, +263 78 258 5433, Bring it on🔥🔥🔥🔥
2025, +263 77 454 8584," Romans 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
2026, +263 77 454 8584: Romans 8,"28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
2027, +263 77 454 8584, Are things really working together for good in your life 🤔
2028, +263 77 454 8584, ‭Romans 8:28 NIV‬
2029, +263 77 454 8584: ‭Romans 8,28 NIV‬
2030, +263 77 454 8584, Most people love this verse
2031, +263 78 026 5054, Not all
2032, +263 77 454 8584, But we then ask ourselves why things are not working together for good in our lives
2033, +263 77 454 8584, We ask ourselves why we suffer despite having a purpose or a prophesy that has been said over our lives
2034, +263 78 849 1118, 😭😭😭no
2035, +263 77 454 8584, You look at everything you do and you say you love the Lord
2036, +263 77 454 8584, This is because  in most times when we read scripture
2037, +263 78 488 1340, Very true
2038, +263 77 454 8584," Romans 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
2039, +263 77 454 8584: Romans 8,"28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
2040, +263 77 454 8584, What is to love God
2041, +263 77 454 8584, The condition for this verse is that
2042, +263 77 454 8584, Saying I love you Lord is not enough
2043, +263 77 454 8584, Praying is not enough
2044, +263 78 849 1118, Yes‼️‼️
2045, +263 77 454 8584, Loving God is hating the things of the flesh
2046, +263 77 454 8584, Loving God is hating evil
2047, +263 77 891 7712, <Media omitted>
2048, +263 77 461 9483, Yes🔥🔥🔥
2049, +263 77 454 8584, ‭Romans 8:7-8 NIV‬
2050, +263 77 454 8584: ‭Romans 8,7-8 NIV‬
2051, +263 77 454 8584," For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit  to God's law indeed it cannot"
2052, +263 77 454 8584, To love God is to please him
2053, +263 77 454 8584, Because the spirit of God brings peace and joy
2054, +263 77 454 8584, The spirit of God brings love that cannot be explained
2055, +263 78 849 1118, The word of the season🔥🔥🔥🔥
2056, +263 77 454 8584, So you cannot claim to love God and still love the things of the flesh
2057, +263 77 454 8584, All things will work together for good for the ones who love the Lord
2058, +263 77 454 8584, The condition is to love the Lord
2059, +263 77 454 8584, Anyone who does not have the spirit of Christ does not belong to him
2060, +263 77 461 9483, Eish😬
2061, +263 77 461 9483, Oh yes🔥
2062, +263 77 454 8584, Romans 8 Verse 14 for all who are led by the spirit are the children of God
2063, +263 77 454 8584, Loving God is allowing the spirit to lead you
2064, +263 77 454 8584, When you are lead by the spirit
2065, +263 77 454 8584, You cannot claim to be a child of God and sin all the time
2066, +263 78 849 1118, 🫵🏾
2067, +263 77 454 8584, God is looking for children who are fully committed to the things of the spirit
2068, +263 77 454 8584, If you are disconnected from the spirit then some verses will not work for you
2069, +263 77 454 8584," There are so many verse in the bible in which God is promising protection, wisdom, prosperity, security"
2070, +263 77 454 8584, The list is endless
2071, +263 77 454 8584, We read some of these verses and we think the Lord has forsaken us
2072, +263 77 454 8584, It's because we do not look at the conditions
2073, +263 77 454 8584, If you Love the Lord you will follow his words
2074, +263 77 454 8584, If you love his you will worship him
2075, +263 77 454 8584, If you love him you will sacrifice for him
2076, +263 77 454 8584, Then you will start to see things work together for good in your life
2077, +263 77 454 8584, Then you will start to see that truly truly is goodness and mercy follows you all the day of your life
2078, +263 77 454 8584, Then you will start to see that if he is for us then who can be against us
2079, +263 77 454 8584, Then you will start to see a thousand on your right ten thousand on your left and non coming near you
2080, +263 77 454 8584, Then you will start to have joy and peace that does not make sence
2081, +263 77 454 8584, You will start to have joy in chaos
2082, +263 77 454 8584, Peace in chaos
2083, +263 77 454 8584, All things really work together for good for the one who loves the Lord
2084, +263 77 454 8584," Look at the areas of your life where you want God to intervene, and it looks like he is not doing anything"
2085, +263 77 454 8584, Then  look at your lifestyle
2086, +263 77 454 8584, Start to follow the things of the spirit and see what the Lord does for his children
2087, +263 77 454 8584, Show your love for the Lord
2088, +263 77 454 8584, If you love the Lord you will follow his words and submit your spirit
2089, +263 77 454 8584, Thank you😇

5041, Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior," Traders begin accepting ZiG currency: Some traders have started accepting ZiG currency after banks successfully configured their digital platforms and the shops reset their prices in the new currency. Other traders are now at an advanced stage to migrate to the use of the new local currency before tomorrow’s deadline. Mainstream large retailers were transacting in both ZiG and foreign currency by allowing those with bank cards to swipe after the banks completed configuring their systems so the cards would work. According to a market update by Zimswitch, which has already completed the roll out of the ZiG processing system, about 15 banks were live with the ZiG by yesterday. These included NMB Bank Limited, POSB, InnBucks, Empowerment Bank, Stanbic Bank, ZB Financial Holdings, Nedbank, CABS, First Capital Bank, Ecobank, One Money, O’mari, My Cash, African Century, EcoCash and Steward Bank, with the few remaining indicating that they would follow suit and beat tomorrow’s deadline. Zimswitch is the country’s sole national payments platform and clearing house. It was incorporated in 1994 to process domestic card-based, both ATM and point of sale “swipe”, and EFT transactions among member financial institutions in real-time online. EcoCash Holdings, the largest local mobile money platform, notified its customers yesterday that it had successfully converted Zimbabwean dollars to ZiG currency although there were delays in letting people spend their ZiG balances on EcoCash products."

5995, Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior," Top eye specialist loses US$108 000 in crypto deal: Renowned eye specialist Solomon Guramatunhu allegedly lost US$108 924 to a crypto currency trader. Lloyd Chiyangwa (31) appeared before Harare regional magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa, who remanded him in custody pending bail ruling. He is also challenging his placement on remand. Prosecuting, Lancelot Mutsokoti alleged that sometime in 2020, Guramatunhu bought crypto currency while in India from a company in the United Kingdom. He returned to Zimbabwe where he engaged Chiyangwa, who trades in crypto currency. Chiyangwa was tasked to set up wallets and five accounts namely Trust, Exodus, Cosmostation, Wemix and Metamask and to set up passwords for these wallets. Between January 7 and January 27, 2024 Chiyangwa transferred 122,467 matic tokens worth US$108 924.24 from Guramatunhu’s Metamask wallet to Waybit exchange. The court heard that Guramatunhu discovered that the tokens were stolen on January 27, 2024 when he intended to move them into another wallet. Chiyangwa is suspected to have used his cellphone to make the transaction. The suspect has other pending court cases where he is facing similar charges – Herald, Tuesday May 7, Pg 5"

6119, Chipo CBZ, Its sad there is a teacher who has been arrested for swipping for someone at Pick n Pay and then used a rate of 15 to get his USD instead of bank rate. The person swipped for is a law enforcement officer deployed under cover to weed out people using unofficial rate. We may be  put in an awkward situation by people we think we are helping🙆🏻‍♂️.
6120, Mr Magwenzin CBZ Superior," Looks like we are going back to shortages soon. Went to one of the shops today the basics like rice, peanut butter, mealie meal were not there. Their prices were in ZIG but if you convert at the previous USD price their rate is 17"

6157, Rufaro, Good morning sir after consulting the bank and communicating with them i have decided to instead build an AI agent for the bank that studies trends and analyses customer preferences to use to for advertising and recommending the banks products and services.
6158, Mr Zvakafa, Put it in writing
6159, Mr Zvakafa, Send it to me
6160, Rufaro, Okay sir let me make a quick draft for you
6161, Mr Zvakafa, Note time is not on your side
6162, Rufaro, yes sir i understand
6163, Mr Zvakafa, Look for a data set that can enable.training of the model of the  recomender engine
6164, Rufaro, Understood sir
6165, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6166, Rufaro, good morning sir i hope you saw my new proposal that i sent last week
6167, Mr Zvakafa, Let me look ar it
6168, Rufaro, Okay thank you
6169, Mr Zvakafa, Cab you explain to me via text or maybe audio how the chatbot will work in production
6170, Rufaro, Okay let me try and record an audio
6171, Mr Zvakafa," From all our conversations , I have received 3 ideas from you. This was the first one"
6172, Mr Zvakafa, This was the second one that you mentioned and you said this was after consulting the bank
6173, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6174, Mr Zvakafa, Today I have received the third one
6175, Mr Zvakafa, This was a recommendation engine for banking products
6176, Mr Zvakafa, This one is securing
6177, Mr Zvakafa," I have seen you changing ideas. What's obvious is you want to do a project that utilize AI for your bank but you are not sure which area do you want to focus on.This complicates and hinders your progress .I am not even sure that after giving you recommendations, will you take them or you will go and find a new idea"
6178, Rufaro, Yes sir sorry about the increase in the number of ideas. You see for the other ideas i end up running into some obstacles mostly on the legal side. regarding access to some of the banks documents. One department can encourage me to try and set up a certain system handling certain information while another department can be very uncomfortable with having to deal with me regarding that mentioned area you see so i am trying to focus more on a project that would avoid or manevuer around their policies. As i do still need support from them on these such systems.
6179, Rufaro," No sir , I do apologize if it does seem like i am disregarding your advice. It's just i am finding it difficult to try and justify otherwise how i can make a project unique with the environment i am in. I do not mean to offend you"
6180, Mr Zvakafa, We have started this journey already and I am your supervisor. One of my duties is to help you craft a research topic ideal for a 3rd year student. Therefore when you meet glitches or you realize it's not feasible you communicate with me .Any change must be communicated. This is why feasibility studies are key
6181, Rufaro, Okay sir
6182, Mr Zvakafa, I am here to help you come up with a solid research idea that you can put into production in your company
6183, Rufaro, Okay sir
6184, Mr Zvakafa, It's either you integrate your solution with CBZ infrastructure or you use alternative infrastructure. Some companies won't even allow you to use their data.So you look for alternative data sets or you create alternative infrastructure. Laiter on you put it into production as per the banking regulations
6185, Rufaro, Okay i understand. Because this side what happened is that the Bank seems to have had a change in some of their policies which are still being communicated to the people supervising me hear and i understand that some other decisions are still in the air regarding those who are working in IT so a new policy can be announced today that could affect my project which is why i was now aiming for a project where the user optionally generates the dataset over time
6186, Rufaro, I want to avoid capturing any confidential data on my own and only use information that is somewhat readily available or always on display something like vocabulary and speech patterns which are if anything made public by individuals willingly especially since that is necessary for users to interact with the bank and its services
6187, Mr Zvakafa, If I did get you.You want to use a chatbot to capture users information(that is their user names and passwords  etc).You store the data.You train a nlp model based on this data .The model will be able  to know if this is the real user? And also you mainly want the data for data recovery
6188, Rufaro," Yes sir the dataset will be generated on the user regularly with each login the chatbot will try and prompt them to speak so the model learns more about them and incase they change how they speak after a while. They will be prompted regularly on each login with a pin and when the model wishes to verify who they are, it may request they write a short paragraph about anything so it compares the way they communicate to the data it has in its dataset"
6189, Rufaro, *I mean each time after they login with a pin they will be prompted to communicate with the chatbot.
6190, Rufaro, It won't demand the user write whole essays but just short paragraphs of maybe even 50 to 100 words or more if the user wishes to enter more information. this data will accumulate in a data set where an algorithm will study the speech patterns and register that pattern under the user of that account. similarities to that pattern will be analyzed when it comes verfication of a user
6191, Mr Zvakafa, So you are focusing on both speech and text
6192, Mr Zvakafa, I don't know wether you will build good data pipelines that will collect the data in real time
6193, Mr Zvakafa, Data pipelines will be critical
6194, Rufaro, Yes speech and text i want to make it applicable to even situations where users do not have the ability to enter audio or text input
6195, Mr Zvakafa, Focus on situation. It's good to be ambitious but narrow your scope and know your target group
6196, Rufaro, Okay sir i will try my best then. How about i will focus on text first then move on to speech after text pattern recognition is successful
6197, Mr Zvakafa, That's why I have said  try to focus on one thing rather than both speech and text
6198, Mr Zvakafa, You will need to build data pipelines that collect all this big data
6199, Mr Zvakafa, AI applications need more data
6200, Mr Zvakafa," You collect the data , and the data must be appropriate with the machine learning model you are using"
6201, Mr Zvakafa, Are creating your own machine learning algorithm or you are creating your own algorithm???
6202, Rufaro, I intend to create my own algorithm and i will be using other online algorithms for reference however if i find an algorithm that is already in use i will use that algorithm instead and will only modify it slightly
6203, Mr Zvakafa, The security aspect using AI must be clear as in how are you using the chatbot and the nlp model to enforce security
6204, Mr Zvakafa, If you are creating your own algorithm then you have to prove its accuracy benchmarking with other algorithms in existence
6205, Mr Zvakafa, I did not get the last objective?
6206, Rufaro, The model is to be used to verify the users identity like a password does on entry. The AI will try and recognize the user by comparing the text input to the text data in the dataset and will grant them access or deny it to them depending on  whether the patterns it analyzes are the same.
6207, Rufaro, Oh like that is were the secure part is. The Idea is that the chatbot will give a go ahead to the backend service to grant you access to the account or services you want like lets say data recovery as i mentioned. It will recognize you as the owner of the account and grant you access to said account so you can enter and maybe even change your password if you forgot it
6208, Mr Zvakafa, You will have these components:
6209, Mr Zvakafa: You will have these components,
6210, Rufaro, yes sir those are the components that i will have in my project
6211, Mr Zvakafa, What's hhe difference between a client entering credentials using a web form and  using a web chatbot??
6212, Mr Zvakafa, Then your data engineering  and machine learning skills  have  to be shaperned
6213, Mr Zvakafa, I don't know how many CBZ cliemts are using  online web based  banking . I have been using CBZ for the last 7 years.I have never used web banking services. I prefer  the mobile app cbz touch because it does nor require data for me to bank
6214, Mr Zvakafa, Don't use the word aims. Coz we have one  aim
6215, Rufaro, Okay sir noted
6216, Mr Zvakafa, It's not necessary when writting an academic document to mention during the time at cbz  what what
6217, Mr Zvakafa, At the end of this project you will produce a smart product(Web chatbot) that enforces security in the bank
6218, Rufaro, I want to open the possibility to tracking individuals who repeatedly try and gain access to the accounts of other users by generating a digital identity that marks users like that with a digital identity that identifies them as a threat to the banks security.
6219, Mr Zvakafa, So  make it clear how this solution is the best for security purposes comparing other bots like whatsapp chatbot or mobile forms like those on other existing applications like cbz touch
6220, Mr Zvakafa, Are you saying this  cannot be achieved through mobile.if that's so then make it clear in your do document
6221, Mr Zvakafa, I think i have replied you. Let me get down to business
6222, Rufaro, Okay sir thank you very much for your time i will do my best with your help
6223, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6224, Mr Zvakafa, <Media omitted>
6225, Mr Zvakafa, In your aim how many models do you want to create??
6226, Mr Zvakafa, Do u have a data set to train these models
6227, Mr Zvakafa, What's the characteristics of your training data set
6228, Mr Zvakafa, To developa machine learning model that does 1.2.3 utilizing  1.2.3
6229, Mr Zvakafa, I have told you so many times objectives start with to  to to
6230, Mr Zvakafa, Objective 1 you want to create or aquire.What is it that you want to do??
6231, Rufaro, Okay sir sorry let me fix that
6232, Rufaro, I want to make use of an AWE to assess an individuals writing skills. So far I have been still trying to find out which is most ideal to use an already designed AWE or to create one from an available ML model
6233, Mr Zvakafa, Objective 2 is
6234, Rufaro, to assess writing perfomance I have the IELTs dataset provided by kaggle
6235, Mr Zvakafa, Make it clear whether u want to create or you want to make use of an existing AWEn
6236, Mr Zvakafa, This is 14 and you don't know kuti ndiri kuda kushandisa chii
6237, Rufaro, Yes I wish to create a simple interface similar to the one on touch where the question is on top followed by a multiline textbox. The user will answer the question in the form of two or more paragraphs then they submit their answer. I will the convert the text to a suitable format using a pipeline I will create using tools provided by sklearn then store it in a dataset
6238, Mr Zvakafa, Make it clear what you want to do
6239, Mr Zvakafa, In a nutshell rephraise for me that objective. The way I understand that objective is you want to just collect data using the web application ( ofcourse through various forms)
6240, Rufaro, Okay I want to collect data from the user using a Web application. The data will be text based.
6241, Rufaro, On submission it is added to a dataset in the backend and then processed later by the model
6242, Mr Zvakafa, Are u training the model online(streaming) or batch
6243, Mr Zvakafa, So you will train the model using the generated data
6244, Mr Zvakafa, ??
6245, Rufaro, The AWE will be trained using the IELTs data set which is batch training
6246, Rufaro, The second model the user predictor will use streaming
6247, Rufaro, I intend to control the number of users who will help train it so I can get data that is as accurate as possible
6248, Mr Zvakafa, Third objective make it clear  that I want to develop a machine learning model .on its own the Word model is too broad. Models utilize various techniques. In this case u are creating a machine learning model
6249, Mr Zvakafa, The reason why I am asking  is machine learning models  must be trained using  large   data sets so that the prediction is accurate
6250, Rufaro," Okay I wish to create a model that uses a DecisionTree to make predictions. The features it will look at will include the users score after AWE's assessment, the question they were answering , the length of their answer and the word order they used"
6251, Mr Zvakafa, You must be able to differentiate whether your problem is a classification problem or regression problem  or a reinforcement problem. You must understand the problem
6252, Rufaro, I understand sir I will try my best to make the audience as large as possible I will try and get permission to openly stream the model as well
6253, Mr Zvakafa, For now I don't want features..I just neeed to know the objective
6254, Mr Zvakafa, What performance measure will use on the model??
6255, Rufaro, Okay sir I wish to use a Classifier model
6256, Rufaro, I wish to use an accuracy score. The model will compare how close it predictions are to the dataset
6257, Mr Zvakafa, In an objective you just tell us the objective as it is .
6258, Mr Zvakafa, Research more on the performance measure
6259, Rufaro, Okay sir
6260, Mr Zvakafa, Make your aim understandable. Make it clear so that the reader don't find problems in understanding it
6261, Rufaro, My objective is
6262, Mr Zvakafa, On the last part of the objective you can add a part on how you wil solve that problem in context
6263, Mr Zvakafa, That's more understandable  now
6264, Rufaro, Noted sir
6265, Mr Zvakafa, List your objectives in  chronological order
6266, Mr Zvakafa, Know what starts first
6267, Mr Zvakafa, The AWE feeds into the data pipeline
6268, Rufaro, Noted
6269, Rufaro, Yes the AWE will also feed its output into the data pipeline as well
6270, Mr Zvakafa, A data pipeline is just  data processing infrastructure that takes data form various sources  .in the context of the bank you might need data coming from various sources
6271, Rufaro, Noted
6272, Mr Zvakafa, Machine Learning Research Dissertation Marking Guide
6273, Rufaro," Understood sir, the AWE, and the cbz touch profile database or a dummy database will be used to feed the pipeline"
6274, Mr Zvakafa, The machine learning workflow is essential  to follow
6275, Rufaro, Thank you very much sir this will be helpful
6276, Mr Zvakafa, Number 1 up to 8 are very critical  in your project involving machine learning
6277, Rufaro, Okay sir noted
6278, Mr Zvakafa," As work on your  project make corrections on your problem statement , aim and  objectives as  I have suggested"
6279, Rufaro, Okay sir noted
6280, Mr Zvakafa, So after this research problem what is our final product??
6281, Rufaro, Thank you very much for your assistance
6282, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6283, Rufaro, Sorry for late submission
6284, Mr Zvakafa, We are now writting a thesis document
6285, Mr Zvakafa, We format as we write the document
6286, Mr Zvakafa," We build on from chapter one .I need a document with chapter 1, 2, 3 combined"
6287, Mr Zvakafa, Formatting and academic writing is key
6288, Mr Zvakafa, Kwete kundipa zvidimbu zvidimbu
6289, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6290, Mr Zvakafa, Noted .will look at it
6291, Mr Zvakafa," Objective 2 , I don't understand the first part if that Objective"
6292, Mr Zvakafa, <Media omitted>
6293, Mr Zvakafa," Objective 3 , don't say other"
6294, Mr Zvakafa, On your aim . The aim is to create a system(wether web /mobile ) that utilizes machine learning. So the objective is to develop a system
6295, Rufaro, Sorry must have been a typing error Objective 2 is: To create a pipeline that will prepare the data for an AWE to assess the grammar in the entered response and feed the response data to the user authenticator model.
6296, Rufaro: Sorry must have been a typing error Objective 2 is, To create a pipeline that will prepare the data for an AWE to assess the grammar in the entered response and feed the response data to the user authenticator model.
6297, Rufaro, Noted
6298, Rufaro, Okay the how about say :To create an AWE model using openai's get model and NLP libraries to assess the grammar and vocabulary from user response and feed the result back into the pipeline
6299, Rufaro: Okay the how about say ,To create an AWE model using openai's get model and NLP libraries to assess the grammar and vocabulary from user response and feed the result back into the pipeline
6300, Mr Zvakafa, All I can say is don't give us  multiple meanings be specific
6301, Mr Zvakafa, U can't say other we become curious what is the other
6302, Rufaro, Noted
6303, Rufaro, good morning
6304, Ngoni, Hey
6305, Ngoni, How is it
6306, Rufaro, it is good the phone is doing pretty well too and i fixed the issue with netone yesterday
6307, Rufaro, now i realize i also probably wasted my time just watching youtube videos once it started working though i really need to improve my perfomance i think.
6308, Ngoni, Which performance do you need to improve?
6309, Rufaro, focus i mean like writing code even on weekends or could it just be my environment maybe that is causing issues
6310, Rufaro, i can write code at work
6311, Ngoni, Probably the environment
6312, Ngoni," Electricity, no table etc"
6313, Rufaro, yeah with all them kids coming around and asking for guavas making demands yelling shouting and screaming at each other i think i will start coming to work even on weekends sometimes so i can do some research and study a bit
6314, Rufaro, should do me some good
6315, Ngoni," Yeah, that could help"
6316, Ngoni, Or you could buy a desk and those laptop powerbanks
6317, Rufaro, laptop powerbank? There is stuff like that out ther e
6318, Rufaro, interesting
6319, Ngoni, Yep. A good cost about 60 to a hundred
6320, Rufaro, okay do they have ones that can take my type of charger though or are they for c Type chargers
6321, Rufaro, Good morning my guy i spoke to mainini Tino yesterday
6322, Ngoni, And what happened?
6323, Rufaro, Oh she says she fine though she is traumatized from the robbery . Babamunini suspects that the robbers could come back for her
6324, Ngoni, They didn't hurt her did they?
6325, Rufaro, she locked her room and they could not get in she did however hear her employees crying and begging for help but she did not come out cause she was terrified
6326, Rufaro, apparently one of her employees was seriously injured and she has been buying medicine for him though and the others are fine
6327, Ngoni, Where was this?
6328, Rufaro, I think dad said in Chirundu
6329, Ngoni," Hmm, how unfortunate"
6330, Ngoni, If they can come back for her then she's in a lot of danger
6331, Ngoni, Means they'd have to invest into a lot of security
6332, Rufaro, yep the thing is that they decided to rob her because that day they saw she bought a pool table and brought it in a good truck to her store or something that is what she said so she did report to police and she believes that the CID are getting involved so we can just hope for the best
6333, Rufaro, Probably guys like fawcet or something cause otherwise they will be in trouble
6334, Rufaro, hey dude i wanna know when you do psychometric tests how often do you get people with similar results or behaviours or are all the results unique for each and every  individual who takes the test or will ever take the test. If these individuals take the same test repetitively or a different test do you get the same results regardless
6335, Ngoni, They might have known
6336, Ngoni, Yep
6337, Ngoni," Well, you could improve especially on things like English and math, but it's mostly unique when it comes to personality assessment. But not entirely unique since personalities can be somewhat grouped together"
6338, Rufaro, Okay Okay i see the thing is i am trying to try and formulate a way of user authentication using AI instead of a person having to use security questions or password or pincode. So you know like a  user simply frequently interacts with an AI agent and that AI agent learns who the user is and can recognize them whenever it interacts with them so it can log them in to their user.
6339, Rufaro, The idea is it collects information from the user and uses that information as the dataset and then gives the user access to whatever account they are using. It would be a more convenient means of security for users and might be a whole lot more secure the more and individual interacts with the AI
6340, Ngoni, More secure than biometrics?
6341, Ngoni, And how is one contacting this agent?
6342, Rufaro, well it will not be more secure than biometrics but is likely to just be more economically physible as the idea is to add it to android applications and make it more convenient for the customer.
6343, Rufaro, good morning how are you
6344, Ngoni, Yo
6345, Ngoni, How's it
6346, Rufaro, Oh it is cool so i Yesterday the bus i boarded ended up running out of fuel when we were like a kilometre from showgrounds imagine and the driver was like eish things are hard guys you know these buses die sometimes. and this other guy at the back of the bus was like the conditions of you not reaching a destination with this here bus of yours to leave us home is that you give us back 50 cents so give me my money nigga
6347, Ngoni, Sounds hectic
6348, Ngoni, Did he give it back?
6349, Rufaro, Of course not man people was upset though and the passengers was like you get us to domboshava late and your bus breaks down before we can get home you know what we promise not to board buses that belong to your company.🤣🤣🤣🤣
6350, Rufaro, The issue is there companies know how us residents of domboshava respond to poor service and they try and punish us for deciding not waste our money on their terribly service and the customers from domboshava just smirk and are like screw you guess what there are open trucks and combis always available so these guys lose more customers by the day as they remain prideful and conceited.
6351, Ngoni, You'd obviously be mad coz man probably figured his fuel might not get home😂😂
6352, Ngoni," Well, nobody likes poor service, so it makes sense. But it seems like it's a lot of commotion with the transport that side."
6353, Rufaro, i know and some guys came with their kombi and were like domboshava 50 cents and guess what the customers where like we would rather walk the whole kilometre
6354, Ngoni, Yo
6355, Ngoni, So I was rewatching one punch season 2
6356, Ngoni," Besides some of the animation, I think the story wasn't so bad"
6357, Ngoni, Oh and konosuba is coming back in 16 days
6358, Rufaro, yeah sure i mean studio JC had issues because of how they had some cutscenes where the characters seemed to be pausing or sticking mid battle
6359, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6360, Rufaro," Also i want to say some of the netflix animations that are not Kengan Ashura are bad as hell , Have you ever watched gamera"
6361, Ngoni, The animation wasn't all that
6362, Rufaro, I know people somehow like frieren But Gintama though what is happening in Gintama right now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6363, Ngoni," Nah, which one is that one?"
6364, Ngoni," Frieren is good, but mmm, it can't be number 1 tho😂"
6365, Ngoni, These guys are ranking frieren higher than HXH and JJK
6366, Rufaro, kind of another Godzilla like storyline animation with Kaiju and all the worst part about gamera was like you could feel as though the writers of the storyline where lazy cause they did have a story and characters among the kaiju who had potential . I would only recommend watching episode 4 cause they introduce this thing called Guiron and it is really unique in the monster universe even the way it fought it was good and it had potential .
6367, Rufaro, Like they introduced a character that had one piece level of ridiculous design but that character is the most dangerous entity because of how they move and fight uniquely and then they had to ruin it with the idea that the hero of the anime cannot lose kind of logic
6368, Rufaro, Did you see the blu ray version of Sukuna vs Mahoraga cause hmmmm that fight scene was unbelievable like when people say mahoraga is dangeroud he is dangerous and sukuna is also indeed strong like damn they added extra scenes and even showed sukuna having fun but the fun started to run out a bit when mahoraga started shadow boxing intentionally trying to hit the slashes so he could adapt and see them.
6369, Rufaro, did HxH get a new season and frieren can't be more popular than AOT can it
6370, Ngoni, You begin to wonder if Netflix doesn't have the budget to get some good writers. They can animate for real but the stories tho. I'll check it out
6371, Ngoni," I ain't seen it, where can i get it"
6372, Ngoni, Nope HXH doesn't have a new season although I've heard rumors that it could be coming
6373, Ngoni," Definitely frieren can't be more popular than aot, I think it's just a new concept, that's why people like it"
6374, Ngoni, They have good story telling and the characters have depth
6375, Rufaro, yeah like the fight scene with guiron you could swear it was good CGI and it made sense but the main character won cause he was the main character and the story as a whole if it starts as comedy action end it as comedy action like gintama but these guys wanted to put some horror and slice of life story into the mix like what . These are giant monsters fighting each other for whatever reason let them just fight
6376, Rufaro, Or maybe it just one of the better new generation anime that doesn't abuse a certain genre like the reincarnation and fantasy series. They become more popular if you are breaking away from following a popular trope right down to the last script after all. Its like one puch man saitama already became the most powerful being in existence and doesn't have any super sad backstory or want to be loved by everyone and yet people like the anime for how simple he makes things
6377, Ngoni, It sucks when that happens. We need convincing wins in anime
6378, Ngoni," People get tired of the same isekai stuff, so yeah, frieren is somewhat refreshing and it's got depth"
6379, Rufaro, yo wassup have you ever done machine learning and is it easy or just challenging
6380, Ngoni, It requires a lot of learning
6381, Ngoni, It's a big challenging but not impossible
6382, Rufaro, Okay cause i was chatting with my supervisor and he was asking all sorts of questions cause my project centers around using machine learning to learn a persons communication patterns so it can recognize any given user by looking at how they text and communicate with them.
6383, Ngoni," Hmm, texting huh🤔"
6384, Ngoni, How do you want to teach it?
6385, Rufaro, collect info like text messages from users by having it prompt users to enter text.
6386, Rufaro, Then store their responses and look at how they speak maybe even record key presses and predict the kind of errors in texting they make and how often along with the topics they usually speak about and how they answer questions
6387, Ngoni, You'd probably need large amounts of text.  How are you going to collect it?
6388, Rufaro, shit that is a challenge indeed like how much do you think i would need anyway
6389, Rufaro, cause the first thing i could try and do would be to load some of my assignments for the meantime into the application or i could try and type just some general information into a notepad file frequently and feed it to my dataset.
6390, Rufaro, another option would be to be able to export and filter whatsapp chat messages to the bot so they can be used as a dataset as well
6391, Ngoni," As much as possible. Recognizing patterns in text is like looking for needle in a haystack so yeah, a lot"
6392, Ngoni, Who's WhatsApp messages?
6393, Ngoni, The hard thing about you task is the data
6394, Ngoni, You'd need different peoples data to confirm that it can identify them
6395, Rufaro, i guess for now the user so for test that will be my whatsapp messages i guess i will do my best and try and see what i can do to accomplish my task
6396, Ngoni, Okay
6397, Rufaro, i will ask for some from my friends of course i guess man i may have bitten off mo than i can chew but that supervisor is getting rather upset or dissatsified with me changing ideas for projects
6398, Rufaro, Yo are you going to meet Dad in Marondera this Easter
6399, Ngoni," You first need to understand what's required for the project, breaking it down step by step coz the idea may sound good but without sufficient knowledge you'll struggle"
6400, Ngoni," Probably, but he's talking about kumusha"
6401, Rufaro, I know he also mentioned that he might be going to Marondera as well so i was hoping to get the opportunity to go and visit dad over the weekend
6402, Rufaro, Oh and a friend of mine wanted to do AI and machine learning but as it it turns out that is not the best decision for the project he wants to use
6403, Rufaro, good morning i got home safe yesterday and was too tired to even be able to cook yet i had to still draw water from the well and clean some of the dishes that i left yesterday
6404, Rufaro, i ended up just eating chicken inn for dinner and two slices of bread
6405, Ngoni, Yo
6406, Ngoni, You bought a 2 piecer?
6407, Rufaro, 1 piecer
6408, Rufaro, a plastiic bag and one coke
6409, Rufaro, it cost over 100000 rtgs
6410, Ngoni, Oh I see
6411, Ngoni, 100000??😂 ih
6412, Rufaro, you have no idea the rate is flying my guy like everyday it goes up and stores try and predict what it will be at tomorrow and use tomorrows rate
6413, Ngoni," Yeah, that's a lot for real"
6414, Ngoni, Konosuba is back
6415, Rufaro, Yes finally been Waiting forever
6416, Ngoni, So there's this course that I bought. It's on udemy. I can give you my credentials and you can use them to log in
6417, Ngoni, So download udemy app
6418, Ngoni, It's on AI
6419, Rufaro, Okay cool what's it about
6420, Rufaro, Okay
6421, Rufaro, Oh sure let me try
6422, Ngoni, So my email: ngonidzashedelight@gmail.com
6423, Ngoni: So my email, ngonidzashedelight@gmail.com
6424, Ngoni, Yo
6425, Ngoni, I need a favor. I need you to collect money from a certain client of mine
6426, Ngoni, Will you be free at some point today?
6427, Rufaro, Yo wassup if I am to be free it will likely be around lunch time
6428, Rufaro," Around 12:00 , 13:00 to 14:00 hrs"
6429, Rufaro: Around 12,"00 , 13:00 to 14:00 hrs"
6430," Rufaro: Around 12:00 , 13",00 to 14:00 hrs
6431," Rufaro: Around 12:00 , 13:00 to 14",00 hrs
6432, Rufaro, It depends on whether I have been given a job or not
6433, Ngoni," Okay let me know. I'll need you to collect the money and deposit it into my bank account, would want you walking around with lots of money"
6434, Rufaro, how much is it anyways?
6435, Rufaro, and which bank account do you have anyways
6436, Ngoni, 300
6437, Ngoni, Stanbic
6438, Rufaro," will there be like a huge queue or something cause i do hate me them qeues,"
6439, Rufaro, or do they work fast often
6440, Ngoni, You ask them to use the deposit machine. Should take about 5 minutes
6441, Rufaro, oh they have a deposit machine amazing 👍👍 okay can do will check for the closest stanbic bank and go make the deposit when i meet the guy just tell me when to meet the guy
6442, Ngoni, You're going to meet a white lady who has a shop in town
6443, Ngoni, Themi Shein CUSTOMER.vcf (file attached)
6444, Rufaro, White lady oh you mean she is a foreigner
6445, Ngoni, She may be Zimbabwean. But she a white lady
6446, Rufaro, Okay Okay no problem
6447, Ngoni," location: https://maps.google.com/?q=-17.83241081237793,31.051877975463867"
6448, Ngoni: location," https://maps.google.com/?q=-17.83241081237793,31.051877975463867"
6449, Ngoni: location: https,"//maps.google.com/?q=-17.83241081237793,31.051877975463867"
6450, Ngoni, Nations hardware opposit mania cycle corner shop you can just msg me I’ll meet you outside
6451, Ngoni, Does it look like you'll be free?
6452, Ngoni, There a stanbic close to her location
6453, Rufaro, well i kinda am even now but someone may come looking for me which is why i always try to head out towards lunch instead
6454, Rufaro, i think i can make a plan to head over there at around 12:00 but let me try and see if can get permission to head out now
6455, Rufaro: i think i can make a plan to head over there at around 12,00 but let me try and see if can get permission to head out now
6456, Ngoni, OK cool
6457, Rufaro, Yo i am bout to head out and meet the lady do i need your bank account number to do the deposit
6458, Ngoni," Yew, let me send the details"
6459, Ngoni, My account number is 9140007773187
6460, Ngoni," Be careful tho, you never know who's watching"
6461, Ngoni, Have you checked the location of the stanbic bank?
6462, Rufaro, cool will be don't worry
6463, Rufaro, let me just check to see
6464, Rufaro, At the bank now
6465, Ngoni, You already received the money?
6466, Rufaro, Finished the depos
6467, Ngoni, Thanks man
6468, Ngoni, It didn't take too long right?
6469, Rufaro, No it didn't also witnessed police brutality and almost got caught up in a public altercation by the parking lot
6470, Rufaro, yo one of my co workers was just arrested my guy the harare police is useless imagine restraining original culprits of a crime and then those guys escape and you go and capture the witnesses instead
6471, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6472, Ngoni, Bokuno hero season 7 has started
6473, Rufaro, WATCH jojo's bizarre adventure episode one is impressive
6474, Rufaro, No I just finished episode one and it is amazing fast paced story telling but all key points are easy to catch and they also got good action that is easy to follow
6475, Ngoni, Isn't it like Gundam? With many different kinds of seasons?
6476, Rufaro, The story revolves around Dio Brando being so petty the guy just trolls and harrases a single family line for eternity cause he did not like the original heir who was around when he was alive
6477, Rufaro, This guy is petty he basically returns to harass numerous generations with no real reason
6478, Rufaro, 🤣🤣🤣 This dude knee jumped the MC's dog just to prove he is better than him imagine
6479, Rufaro, Even the dog was like wtf😨😨😨 my guy I just wanted to say hi
6480, Rufaro, 🤣🤣🤣🤣 was a pretty nice first episode for me
6481, Ngoni, Knee jumped?
6482, Rufaro, You need to see the scene my guy that was a knee jump on episode one when Dio meets Jojo
6483, Ngoni, Which jojos is this? I know there's a bunch of them
6484, Rufaro, I will check which one it is I wanted to start from the first one after all
6485, Ngoni, Yeah check it out
6486, Ngoni," Coz I've tried jojos, but I found there's a lot"
6487, Ngoni," Ever been watching something and think hmm, these guys skipped a frame?"
6488, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6489, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6490, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6491, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6492, Rufaro, Whooo yo there was a hell lot of work to do this weekend man and i did not even know to come to work imagine
6493, Rufaro, The guys at work were so busy they forgot to call me though they said it would have been better if i was here on saturday or stayed later on Friday
6494, Rufaro, Have you heard of AWE's dude
6495, Rufaro, i might be able to use that for my project like imagine if i was to grade people on their perfomance on certain given mini paragraphs they enter so i predict whether it is them or not
6496, Rufaro, that is another option although i will have a lot of work to do regardless.
6497, Rufaro, I am still considering the alternative of that and voice recognition though so i will see what happens.
6498, Ngoni, Must have been real busy huh
6499, Ngoni, What's that?
6500, Rufaro," You have no idea oh my manager was like ""Tonight some people are not going to sleep so i am going to determine who will not sleep today and it will be (looks at me ) , not you, you should go home"". And i am like ""Okay "" , (he looks at the other lady in my office and is like) ""You are staying we need you and , nigel and brendon to be  on standby to help us take the system on live and once you are done we realize there is not merrit in sending you home in a taxi so you are going to sleep at a hotel."" In my head i am like ""Bruuuuuuh i also wanna sleep over at a hotel like come on man let me stay over"""
6501, Rufaro, Automated Writing Evaluator (AWE) basically using ML to score someone's essay
6502, Rufaro, i was thinking about using that to try and score peoples answers to the security questions so my system can learn who often has such and such a number of scores and determine who the users is through that score you know.
6503, Ngoni," Oh, sounds intense. Is it because of the zig thing?"
6504, Ngoni, Oh I see
6505, Ngoni, How would you be scoring these answers exactly?
6506, Rufaro, If i maybe score an individuals essay multiple times and store their scores i may be able to make a system that will remember your perfomance overtime that is an idea that i have though i am also considering speech recognition patterns like since voice doesn't change and it may be more convenient and secure although i would need a means to combat things like the new threat that is AI deepfakes and prerecorded audios so i am trying to see which option is better and more practical for me to implement cause i think i can actually get AWE model and then use that model for my project online for free. That is also the same thing i believe is possible for Voice matching system as well.
6507, Rufaro, I can score them according to the IELTS(International English Language Testing System ) so as long as i have them manually enter information than use grammarly i may be able to make a unique score pattern for each individual who tries to enter information in the system
6508, Rufaro, Yo wassup
6509, Rufaro, I saw sekuru Chitanda today and guess what
6510, Rufaro, People are afraid to bank their bonds cause they think they will get arrested
6511, Ngoni, For prerecorded stuff you simply ask them to say random things
6512, Ngoni, Let's see how it gets
6513, Ngoni, Why would they be arrested?
6514, Rufaro, If you deposit more than 100000 bond notes the bank will ask you to wait for the FIU they will interrogate you and ask why you have so many bond notes
6515, Ngoni, Yeah that's scary 😂
6516, Rufaro, Haha my guy the bank is empty and we gonna lose many more clients
6517, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6518, Rufaro, Yo today i made my first model by myself. It predicts the Global sales for dfferent video games over the past years i guess maybe a decade or so but the dataset is huge anyway i think i am getting close enough to create the system that i wished to make you know i can only hope that i manage.
6519, Rufaro, I am still waiting for feedback from my supervisor though
6520, Ngoni, how does it not look like real skin?
6521, Ngoni, that's dope....how big's the dataset?
6522, Ngoni, Oh i see
6523, Rufaro, Like you can tell it was like someone just colored it with some shades and stuff
6524, Rufaro, It's like a really good painting where you gotta squint to tell its a painting
6525, Rufaro, 1mb I guess still gonna double check if it was really correct tomorrow
6526, Ngoni, Oh I see
6527, Ngoni, That's not that big
6528, Rufaro, However the dataset for the AWE is about 3.6mb
6529, Rufaro, I will then also create another dataset (relativelysmall for my project to predict tye user interacting with the systemas well )
6530, Rufaro, Huge datasets take long to make after all
6531, Ngoni," Alright just do what you can but the bigger the dataset, the better"
6532, Rufaro, Yeah you do have a point let me see what I can do about that cause I could start making one as I am getting ready to develop the model
6533, Rufaro, Yo new LLM's are being made day  by day and it is unbelievable
6534, Rufaro, some are just being made by students participating in competitions trying to make ML models for practice
6535, Ngoni, They are not exactly new. It's the same ones being modified often. Once in a while we have a new LLM but it's usually llama and chat gpt
6536, Rufaro, No like i understand some people seem to be just building them from the ground up though yeah some of them are using already prebuilt LLM's
6537, Rufaro, Kaggle provides a lot of datasets that people can use after all to create their models
6538, Ngoni, Ground up? That's a lot of work
6539, Rufaro, They like we doing it for educational purposes or something like that
6540, Ngoni, Oh I see
6541, Ngoni," Rdc world be like 'one hashira can beat all the titans"""
6542, Rufaro, What is he smoking like come on my guy Don't underestimate them titans
6543, Rufaro," Is he high cause the female, warhammer , armored would kinda be hard to handle then you gotta deal with the colossal as well"
6544, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6545, Rufaro, The colossal transforms while he is in 1km radius he is dying worse if its the eren founding titan as well that thing would waste him maybe he could escape
6546, Rufaro," I see him beating female, cart , jaws , attack ,beast and the abnormal titans"
6547, Rufaro," The armored is a draw probably , the warhammer is a draw the colossal that is a loss no doubt"
6548, Ngoni, Could it transform before the sound hashira has cut off his head? That nigga fast as hell
6549, Rufaro, If he know who he is fighting before it happens and remember them titans can pull miracles imagine they pull a reigner where they move their consciousness to their spine before you cut his head off automatic transformation
6550, Rufaro, Everybody is ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
6551, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6552, Rufaro, Yeah but the colossal is a nuke if they fails like I was saying to kill him on the first hit you dead its like a cursed sorcerer fighting mahoraga for the first time if he don't die on the first hit you gonna die
6553, Rufaro, They could beat most of the titans except the abnormal titan shifter eren and the colossal probably
6554, Rufaro, To beat the colossal they would have to attack after he transforms and runs out of energy basically only way to win
6555, Ngoni," Those guys cut heads for a living, no way they'd fail that"
6556, Rufaro, Transferring consciousness remember reigner ?
6557, Rufaro, Maybe cutting him to bits in an instant may work through the neck and torso maybe
6558, Ngoni," Colossal would fall, even to someone like zenitsu. All he needs to do is run away at lightning speed when it transforms the come back later to strike the neck"
6559, Ngoni, You can't transfer shit if your head is on the floor
6560, Rufaro, Trainer did it twice the he'll you talking about the second time he didn't even have his head anymore
6561, Rufaro, Though it could be plot armour
6562, Rufaro, Will they have plot armour in this fight cause if so eren winning too in normal titan form
6563, Rufaro, I mean attack titan
6564, Ngoni, Do you think reiner would able to beat that upper four?
6565, Rufaro, He would probably die at upper 6 but upper 5 would die that one was a fraud
6566, Rufaro, I would say eren knowing the future may be a problem for even upper 3 maybe even 1 depending on what future he sees cause I believe the ability to see the future affects it as well
6567, Ngoni," In the demon slayer world,  those titans don't really stand a chance. They're too slow and have obvious weaknesses."
6568, Ngoni, Eren's too slow
6569, Rufaro, Don't underestimate them though if they catch off guard it would mean death
6570, Rufaro, Here is another take one piece pirate's vs ninjas from naruto even gecko moria could beat a number of them ninjas
6571, Rufaro, And whitebeard in his prime can can beat pain
6572, Ngoni, Mmm that's a difficult one now
6573, Ngoni," Which ninjas, there's too many of them"
6574, Rufaro, Gecko Maria vs hidan or deidara
6575, Rufaro, Crocodile vs gaara
6576, Rufaro, Fujitora vs kakashi or obito
6577, Rufaro, Afternoon
6578, Ngoni, Yo
6579, Ngoni, How's it
6580, Rufaro, Was doing a bit of ml today and guess what preprocessing is hard phew
6581, Rufaro, Sklearn gives a lot of tools and models that can be used for building your own models but the part about preprocessing maybe one of the hardest parts
6582, Rufaro, How was work
6583, Ngoni, It's a lot of work dude. Did you manage to create a good enough dataset?
6584, Rufaro, Not yet need to decide the parameters of my dataset
6585, Rufaro, First I will get short paragraphs from my audiences I guess
6586, Rufaro, Should probably use Microsoft forms for convenience
6587, Ngoni, Oh okay
6588, Ngoni, Yeah probably
6589, Ngoni, Yo
6590, Ngoni," When you went to deposit money at the bank, was the deposit machine inside or outside?"
6591, Rufaro, at the bank it was just inside in the foyer like place.
6592, Rufaro, It is besides the spot were the ATM is like to the right that is if you want to use the same bank that i went to which was i think in nelson mandela street
6593, Ngoni, OK thanks
6594, Ngoni, Did you listen to the story I shared in the group?
6595, Rufaro, You mean the baboon guy
6596, Ngoni, Yeah
6597, Rufaro, Didn't finish it where did you get the audio man 🤣🤣🤣
6598, Rufaro, Okay finished it now that is the worst way of getting robbed I can think of
6599, Rufaro, I mean I think being robbed at gunpoint is better to be honest
6600, Ngoni, 27 dollars 😂😂
6601, Ngoni, Guy was robbed
6602, Ngoni, Imagine those guys going to beitbridge😂😂
6603, Rufaro," You couldn't even get mad cause what if you said ""ndakupai mari wangu and then it starts barking at you"
6604, Rufaro, I can hardly think how that would end did they not alight with this dude though
6605, Ngoni, The fact that it was talking manje😂
6606, Rufaro, Well all kinds of things happen in this country after all
6607, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6608, Ngoni, Didn't I tell you it was fake?
6609, Ngoni, Oh I hadn't told you yet
6610, Ngoni, I figured it out all the way
6611, Rufaro, Oh how did you find out I though you said it sounded like a good deal
6612, Ngoni, They basically are aiming at stealing steal your money through the 'transport' fee
6613, Rufaro, What ???  Thieves are becoming more and more creative nowadays aren't they
6614, Ngoni," So this is how I figured it out, they will post a car, but if you do an image search of the car you will realize that they are stealing images from other accounts, I found one of the cars on an Instagram page of a company called high class car sales. The image was from 2022"
6615, Ngoni," They take the image, and tell you they have the car, they don't. It's all fake"
6616, Ngoni, The other thing that gave them aways was the pricing. A new Toyota aqua cost 7k to 8k
6617, Ngoni, They would sell it for 5k
6618, Rufaro, But won't you end up having to rent a car though so how will it go if you try to rent a car they do not have
6619, Ngoni, That's impossible
6620, Rufaro, That mean the car is second had or simply some other fake brand like a Tayota like how the awesome store from gumball had a TV called soppy
6621, Ngoni," And finally, I noticed that they posted a car they had claimed to have sold before. So their group has disappearing text but I was sure they posted the car twice. How is that possible when they had sold the car"
6622, Ngoni," They are in Beitbridge. So they say they will deliver the car to you after you have paid the transport fee, the question is, will they really?"
6623, Rufaro, Hmmm that is like some desperate type of marketing to get some form of income from scamming people
6624, Rufaro, You remind me of the furniture delivery service that would scam people out of their money by accepting money and never actually delivering the furniture
6625, Ngoni," No no no, even if it's second hand. Dude, a second hand car with a mileage of 70000 km is basically brand new. Those cars are they ones sold for 8000. The same car if it were really brand new it would sell for about 10000"
6626, Rufaro, Damn like people out here thinking of creative ways to steal what they actual he'll man
6627, Rufaro, That is all kinds of wrong
6628, Ngoni," I can assure you, they do not have the cars they claim to have. It's simply not possible"
6629, Ngoni," Maybe they do have cars, but the ones they are saying are available for renting, those cars don't exist, they are stolen pictures"
6630, Rufaro, Damn do they then require you to give them money first before they give you a car
6631, Ngoni," One other thing is, if they really were giving people these cars, how come they have never posted it? Lots of car dealers will ask if they can take a picture of you and your new car to put on their page, these guys don't have a single one. So the question is to whom are they selling? It's all fake <This message was edited>"
6632, Rufaro," What The Hell(Imagine in Steven he accent from ""emotional damage accent"") this another type of scam what is wrong with them anyway"
6633, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6634, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6635, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6636, Ngoni, Asi there's a lot of unrealistic expectations?
6637, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6638, Rufaro, Yo wassup
6639, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6640, Ngoni, Yo
6641, Ngoni, Let me try to finish it
6642, Rufaro, Okay sure
6643, Rufaro, Have you ever written a methodology for a research before
6644, Ngoni, Yeah
6645, Ngoni, Final year
6646, Rufaro, Is the methodology like a list of steps I followed or instructions that others can follow if they want to replicate my research
6647, Ngoni, It's the techniques you're using in the process of creating whatever you're creating
6648, Ngoni, Like how did you create your dataset
6649, Ngoni, How did you clean it
6650, Ngoni, How did you analyze and train etc
6651, Rufaro, Oh I see
6652, Rufaro, Okay thanks
6653, Rufaro, Also if you could get your hands on your methodology could you give it to me
6654, Rufaro, Yo Did you manage to finish the movie
6655, Ngoni," Hmm, I'll look to see if I still have it"
6656, Ngoni," Nope, not yet"
6657, Rufaro, Oh okay not a problem then
6658, Rufaro, So lately today I was watching this YouTube channel called.lostreak.chicken and I realised that this university education system is too overwhelming
6659, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6660, Ngoni," Hmm, I see. The traveling is obviously a hustle and takes a lot of time. So when it comes to studying, you could do it a little different. Sometimes when you have time you can do the studying at work, that way, you won't need to pressure yourself to do it when you get home. That's only if it's possible at work."
6661, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6662, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6663, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6664, Ngoni, Just focus on your work man. If they say you're easily replaced then it might not be worth to fight over opinions even though you have a better solution
6665, Ngoni, Ego is a thing in these companies and some people just want to do the bare minimum to get along
6666, Rufaro, Exactly like I see this resulting in mass retirements where the thing is this is what cbz wants to a certain extent cause of the merger with zb Bank but I believe the rate of resignations will be more than the bank can handle cause I made an application that merges excel files and can be used to collect certain data for my workmate imagine he resigns I finish attachment and someone else comes wanting to do the same task as him they might not even know the application exists and even if they do they may not know how to get it either
6667, Ngoni," They are a big business, they'll probably know how to take care of it. All you can do is focus on you and mind your own business coz, it'll be stressful otherwise. I say don't even listen to those that want to resign, they want others to do the same as them but remember you're not the same. So set your own goals, let them resign, for you it's just attachment, you're doing it for your grade, and for connections to the bank."
6668, Rufaro, yo wassup how are you doin g
6669, Rufaro, Good afternoon how are you doing i am good here learning more and more on machine learning and will likely be able to make my project successfully i am hoping.
6670, Ngoni, Hey hey
6671, Ngoni, That's dope
6672, Ngoni, What have you leant so far?
6673, Rufaro, I learnt more on data manipulation took a 4 hour course on kaggle
6674, Ngoni, That's dope
6675, Ngoni, was it on pandas?
6676, Rufaro, Yeah pandas
6677, Rufaro, The guys here also lecturing me on model perfomance training prerequisites and more so soon I will have a model ready and set for use
6678, Rufaro, Gone for etiquette training today they be making some of our clothing choices difficult think I may have to go shopping for new clothes later
6679, Ngoni, OK so that's good
6680, Ngoni," You will have to, what do they suggest you should wear?"
6681, Rufaro, Yeah I am still trying to find a direction on how my model will tackle the problem and what kind of data I will transform
6682, Rufaro, Yeah but this broke nigga don't like formal wear and you know it
6683, Ngoni, Oh I see
6684, Ngoni, How formal are they talking about? Is could actually be cheap
6685, Rufaro," Business formal, semi formal or smart casual"
6686, Ngoni, Oh I see
6687, Ngoni, You can get some nice formal-ish shoes for 25
6688, Ngoni, Then shirts for 10 bucks and chinos for 10 to 12
6689, Rufaro, Okay I will try and look for some at the shops later
6690, Rufaro, Good morning anyways did you hear about Rutendo
6691, Ngoni, Nope
6692, Ngoni, What happened?
6693, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6694, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6695, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6696, Ngoni, Baby clothes
6697, Ngoni, You can't go wrong with those
6698, Rufaro, I will get her baby boots then maybe pampers
6699, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6700, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6701, Ngoni, That's great. But did she really call her Rufaro?
6702, Ngoni," Oh, finally. What will you be crunching bro?"
6703, Rufaro, Don't know
6704, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6705, Ngoni, Why would they be turning it off?
6706, Ngoni, Interesting
6707, Rufaro, I am not sure there but will probably find out later
6708, Rufaro, So this side water is almost out and we going back to bahai while planning our way forward whether to blast the stone under the well or to dig a deeper borehole
6709, Rufaro, Borehole will cost a bargain minimum of 500 dollars so hoping to blast the well for something like 50 dollars if possible
6710, Ngoni, Back to what?
6711, Ngoni," Sounds like even tho the borehole is expensive, it might be a better option in the long run, but getting the money tho"
6712, Rufaro, Oh we buy water from bahai monthly
6713, Rufaro, We pay for 2 dollars to get four buckets worth of water everyday
6714, Ngoni, Two dollars per month?
6715, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6716, Ngoni, Oh I see
6717, Rufaro, Yeah the borehole only works when there is electricity though so problem is that the power cuts result in no water for some periods of time
6718, Ngoni, That would suck big time
6719, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6720, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6721, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6722, Ngoni, Progress man💪
6723, Rufaro, yo the new currency is out
6724, Rufaro, the notes and coins i mean
6725, Rufaro, https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-R6JG6TTGeNC7R59rbsBblX45MtCDizVwvbcMK061CzTGgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link

6727, Rufaro, can you check out this form i made do you think that withit i can collect sufficient text data for my machine learning algorithm to make predictions with the data it has
6728, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6729, Rufaro, Feedback on what it feels like to be assessed by my UZ supervisor
6730, Ngoni, Do you have it?
6731, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6732, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6733, Rufaro, That was a mistake igno
6734, Rufaro, Ignore that one
6735, Ngoni," Depends on how much data you want, the struggle is gonna be getting people to fill in with enough data, coz your questions require long answers"
6736, Rufaro, I want to see how much text data I can gather from people and if it would be enough
6737, Rufaro, I thought so but that is the whole point I will continue to search for data on kaggle though
6738, Ngoni, Yo😂😂
6739, Ngoni, Oh I see
6740, Rufaro, I have made peace with the possibility of failure already so yep there is that
6741, Ngoni," You can even go as far as mining tweets for text, so that you have a larger dataset"
6742, Ngoni, Just try your best
6743, Rufaro, That is actually a good idea thanks I could use that
6744, Rufaro, Yo how are you doing
6745, Ngoni, How's it
6746, Ngoni, I'm alright
6747, Rufaro, I am good my models are getting better and I have decided to build hierarchical models
6748, Rufaro, I should have a working prototype by maybe month end if all goes well and I also get good training resources
6749, Rufaro, I want to ask my friends for some of their WhatsApp chats of course so I can have the models learn
6750, Rufaro, Also have I was told Rutendo's baby is called Hailey
6751, Ngoni, Oh that's nice
6752, Ngoni, Month end seems reasonable
6753, Ngoni," Oh okay, sounds good"
6754, Ngoni," Oh, is she a fan of the joker or something"
6755, Rufaro, Also watch ninja kamui my guy
6756, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6757, Rufaro, Yeah I liked that part to though the robot part is a turn of for a number of fans
6758, Rufaro," The deaths are awesome it's like animation studios have a hard time nowadays mixing fast paced action, visibility and choreography so ninja kamui was refreshing for me"
6759, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6760, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6761, Ngoni," Oh, so he's pretty good"
6762, Ngoni, Coz it definitely had the same vibe
6763, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6764, Ngoni, Almost like what happened to AOT when they introduced CGI
6765, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6766, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6767, Ngoni, They be training some judo😂😂
6768, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6769, Ngoni, That's a judo move bro😂😂
6770, Rufaro, That is what I was thinking and all this over change imagine
6771, Rufaro, People have become very aggressive due to hard times right now and it is becoming scary to even say good morning to your neighbour if you have not established that you are friends
6772, Ngoni," There's no change out there, it sucks"
6773, Ngoni, Yeah
6774, Ngoni, Have you touched zig yet?
6775, Rufaro, No not yet the bank ran out of notes within two days of the introduction of the zig
6776, Rufaro, First day there was an immense queue outside the bank like ridiculously long ass queue
6777, Ngoni, Oh wow
6778, Ngoni, I have somebody who was wondering why people were queuing up
6779, Rufaro, Most people are paid in zig nowadays and so what that means as money changers are also being arrested is that the people will need to carry cash with them for business to work
6780, Rufaro, If you wanna buy groceries at home go buy with zig that is the idea
6781, Rufaro, Did you finish kung fu panda by the way
6782, Ngoni, So are people buying it also arrested?
6783, Ngoni," Yeah i did, not bad"
6784, Rufaro, Yep you is money laundering cause both of you is changing the currencies
6785, Ngoni, Oh I see
6786, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6787, Ngoni," Exactly, the villains reason wasn't all that"
6788, Ngoni, No depth
6789, Ngoni, Kai and Tai long were understandable
6790, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6791, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6792, Ngoni, Shen just wanted to kill people
6793, Ngoni, He was serious
6794, Ngoni, Kai and Tai Lung were mu favorite tho
6795, Rufaro, Yeah I almost feel the story writer for the chameleon may have been different than the guys from the other movies
6796, Rufaro, Tai long is legendary especially that prison break out scene
6797, Rufaro, Like it was well scripted and the action was fun it gave a unique perspective to dreamworks action animation with kung-fu
6798, Rufaro, I can tell the difference between kung-fu panda style fight scenes and other animation studio fight scenes die to it somehow
6799, Ngoni, That prison break was classic 🤌
6800, Ngoni, The thing with the other movies was you couldn't tell if Po would even be able to win
6801, Ngoni, The chameleon movie I felt Po would win all day
6802, Rufaro, True I think this was just because they wanted to wrap up the story of Po which is why they made him weaker or he decided to just let the fox be the one to defeat the chameleon
6803, Ngoni, So the fox is gonna be the next dragon warrior then
6804, Rufaro, Yep according to the movie
6805, Ngoni," Hmm, we still want Po tho"
6806, Ngoni, He's still a teenager 🤷‍♂️
6807, Rufaro, Yeah but this is how they wanted kung-fu panda to go so the fox will probably be the new hero unless Po continues going on adventures as the master teaching his student then maybe
6808, Ngoni," Hmm, sounds like it'll suck"
6809, Rufaro, I feel like it will cause the brand of kung-fu panda is built of Po

6821, Ngoni, What's happening to the game?
6822, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6823, Ngoni, <Media omitted>
6824, Ngoni, Obviously I'd want my refund too
6825, Ngoni, What they be doing making it harder for people 🤷‍♂️
6826, Rufaro, I am not sure there is a lot happening in the game industry right now where a lot of the AAA game studios and companies are trying to squeeze money out the customers pockets
6827, Rufaro, Customers end up wanting to go with indie games that are working with lesser known and smaller studios in the end cause these studios won't play stupid games with them
6828, Ngoni, Indie games is the way
6829, Ngoni, These guys sometimes really be trying to kill people's pockets
6830, Rufaro, GTA is supposed to cost about $80 on release that is how bad the game industry is getting

6834, Ngoni, Metro dropped one too?😂
6835, Ngoni, People will buy it tho
6836, Rufaro, I don't know how drake gonna be sleeping tonight honesty
6837, Ngoni, Man needs sleeping pills
6838, Rufaro, Yup a lot of them but kendrick will probably drop another disstrack as an alarm for drake
6839, Ngoni," Probably, 5 said he still got 5 more"
6840, Rufaro, 5 more that guy hates drakes existence damn
6841, Ngoni, It's basically an album at this point
6842, Rufaro, Yup his response to a Diss is to release an album 🤣🤣🤣
6843, Ngoni, Bet he's in the studio right now 😂

6862, Ngoni," Nah, shadaya small fry"
6863, Rufaro, Remember shadaya called J Cole a bitch for apologising to kendrick
6864, Ngoni, Once in a while you should come and sleep over man
6865, Ngoni, When you don't feel like traveling
6866, Rufaro, Yeah sure maybe on weekends
6867, Rufaro, Yo wassup
6868, Ngoni, Yo
6869, Rufaro, this morning was late to work cause i did not want to board a trip trans
6870, Rufaro, i am not even upset about it cause i know that it i did board that bus i would not be making it to work
6871, Rufaro, They wanted customers so bad they refused to allow all other buses to board as long as customers did not board their bus till they were in standing
6872, Rufaro, Ndazotisiya vanhu vakutoda kutanga violence with one conductor from trip trans when this other Zupco driver came by and was like i don't work with trip trans i am not gonna wait in line i got a job to do.
6873, Ngoni, They refused all other buses? That's crazy
6874, Ngoni," Yeah, he was right to do that. Why don't people like trip trans?"
6875, Rufaro, Bro they treat you like they herding cows it is ridiculous like you could simply want to just take a sit and go home and these guys would want to stop and every bus stop to pick up passengers even when the bus is full of standing and after the bus is full they will start packing you together like laundry
6876, Rufaro, the worst part is they have been known to get physical if you complain and they hire too many conductors just for the point of getting physical
6877, Ngoni," Stopping at every bus station is the worst, you could easily take two hours for a journey that's supposed to be an hour long"
6878, Ngoni," Hmm, sounds like some terrible business"
6879, Ngoni, What time do you get off work?
6880, Rufaro, That is what ends up happening
6881, Rufaro, 16:30 sometimes maybe even at 16:00
6882, Rufaro: 16,30 sometimes maybe even at 16:00
6883, Rufaro: 16:30 sometimes maybe even at 16,00
6884, Ngoni, And i can imagine the pain of having people keep coming in when the bus is already full. You won't even be able to breathe in there
6885, Ngoni, Oh I see
6886, Rufaro, Yo how are you doing so Ano has arrived in town just giving you a heads up before he storms over to your office
6887, Rufaro, i couldn't keep him here with me cause there is the issue of security and just allowing strangers into the bank and he has never been to domboshava so i thought he could stay over there with you it would be fine
6888, Ngoni, It's okay. I already met him
6889, Rufaro, cool just checking to make sure nobody ends up disappearing with all the weird stuff that happens nowadays after all. Also help the dude look smart tomorrow so he be okay when he gets to campus tomorrow
6890, Rufaro," Today i was making a model with neural networks and it got 83% accuracy and my supervisor was like ""No way this kid already working well with neural networks this fast"" He checks my models notices that they are just as accurate with another shallow model that is simpler and is like ""how big is your dataset"""
6891, Rufaro," I go ""its 719 rows"" and he goes ""yeah use neural networks only for large ammounts of data not small like that otherwise it could just cram the information you fed it "" , so now i want to check what happens when i give it unseen data. will update you on my progress for this week with machine learning but it is challenging."
6892, Ngoni," Okay i see. Yeah he's right, it might overfit if there's small amounts of data"
6893, Rufaro, And I was kinda happy and disappointed at the same time too 😔😔😔
6894, Ngoni, Why would you be disappointed exactly?
6895, Rufaro, i did a tutorial on another deep learning model and it got a 100% accuracy so i was like this could help me get 100% accuracy as well for other problems and it then i got the results that i got
6896, Rufaro, i may still have a bit of a ways to go but i will make someday or another i am sure
6897, Ngoni, That's machine learning man
6898, Ngoni, There aren't that many models with a hundred percent accuracy
6899, Rufaro, Yeah I understand the guys I work with be talking about making their models 99 to 90% accurate so I am gonna have to keep trying for a while I guess
6900, Ngoni, Yeah keep it going
6901, Ngoni, Anything above 90 is okay
6902, Rufaro, Yeah will aim for that
6903, Rufaro, Yo how is Ano
6904, Ngoni, He's coming to your place today
6905, Rufaro, oh is  that so what time does he want to meet in town
6906, Rufaro, i often get off at around 16:30
6907, Rufaro: i often get off at around 16,30
6908, Rufaro, also give him my jersey
6909, Rufaro, i don't watch soccer but a free shirt is always appreciated that is all i have to say
6910, Ngoni, At 4
6911, Ngoni, Contact him
6912, Ngoni," Hmm, I wonder where I put it"
6913, Ngoni, We'll see
6914, Rufaro, seems like his phone is not online
6915, Rufaro, <Media omitted>
6916, Rufaro, Yo got home with Ano safely
6917, Ngoni," Nice, what time?"
6918, Ngoni, 99% AI
6919, Rufaro, 19:15
6920, Rufaro: 19,15
6921, Rufaro, Yep hehe 😜 😅 ☺️
6922, Ngoni, Every article I write these days is detected as 99% AI
6923, Rufaro, Really could be a case of the AI learning the wrong patterns
6924, Ngoni," If we trained AI to write like humans, should it be ""99% Human""🤔"
6925, Rufaro, No it shouldn't because AI makes minimal mistakes too few to be a human especially with how humans also make punctuation errors and have different word patterns they use that are not ideal
6926, Ngoni, It was trained on human data
6927, Rufaro, Hand picked human data as far as I am concerned takes the best from a number of us.
6928, Rufaro, It ends up reviewed and looked at to get the best of written language grammar and dialect that by itself would make the model far too good to be human
6929, Ngoni," Not really, it still can't write like the best of us because it lacks creativity"
6930, Rufaro, Well yeah it does lack creativity however this may now be an issue of inspiration and idiolism
6931, Rufaro, Yo wassup
6932, Rufaro, Ano is saying he is gonna wait for dad on Monday in harare
6933, Ngoni, Oh okay
6934, Ngoni, That's cool too
6935, Rufaro, I am showing him the place around here and all
6936, Ngoni, You shown him the town and all?
6937, Rufaro, Yeah took him to the shops
6938, Ngoni, Yo
6939, Ngoni, First episode of kimetsu no yaiba is out
6940, Rufaro, Yeah I saw people on YouTube talking about it I just got distracted and never noticed

7088, Rufaro: right now he is at Ngoni's place he will probably try and reach campus at around 7,30 a.m
7089, Peter Mavhima, Alright l will get in touch with him

7096, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Hey hey
7097, Rufaro, hello there it is now morning again asi phone haina power during the day
7098, Rufaro, when you get this message give me the phone number of that other friend of yours you know the one we met outside the bank
7099, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Bundle 😪
7100, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Short Mess🥰😇🫠.vcf (file attached)
7101, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Carol
7102, Rufaro, thank you very much a friend of mine mentioned he would like to meet her or something like that
7103, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, The one you work with?
7104, Rufaro, don't worry i will not sell her contacts to advertisers who offered me a lot of money or anything 😜😜😜
7105, Rufaro, yep the guy likes girls a lot so i do not know if this is another candidate for a new girlfriend cause i understand him and his old girlfriend broke up so who knows
7106, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, People these days😂🙌
7107, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, 😂😂make money my brother
7108, Rufaro," Yeah the guy is looking for girsl probably gonna be the same thing happening on campus the moment you set foot on it there are gonna be pimps i don't pimp girls so i will not interact with her myself, he will have to hit on her himself and if she rejects him end of story otherwise if not then i played cupid i guess who knows other than god"
7109, Rufaro, I would have been rich enough to come and visit you guys in Chinhoyi if that was the case
7110, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, 😂yey yah
7111, Tadiwanashe Nzenze," Do people actually make such deals ,or its all in theory"
7112, Rufaro, well can't really tell but i think that is the issue cause some people be always advertising some one thing or the other.
7113, Rufaro, It could also just be people who are just advertising their own services though
7114, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Oh ok
7115, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, 😂😂people's drama will never end
7116, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Lets say im to change my number on whatsapp what happens?do i still see pipo's statuses and continue being in my old groups?
7117, Rufaro, yeah you should since your phone should be able to remember those individuals
7118, Rufaro, but keep in mind that some of the contacts that you saved in your sim card may not show the names of the people after you change your number unless they are saved in your device
7119, Rufaro, good afternoon my sister are you broke yet? me too send me some emotional support and pray for me. Congratulations ndakanzwa kuti Kupa na Danny varikupasa ku school asi usaudze kupa kuti ndamuita congratulations cause you know anozodemander mari.
7120, Rufaro, on a side note don't forget to tell your friend that i have her number and i wish to give it to a friend of mine only one person. Just so she is not surprised to hear someone greet her on whatsapp.
7121, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Okay Okay
7122, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Good afternoon
7123, Rufaro, Oh you online now huh are you home yet you should go and congratulate Kupa dad already said that she made demands that he be there to congratulate her so now we hustling with her to make sure that happens

7140, Rufaro, Haaa you have no idea right now i am trying to teach a computer how to guess if a person is the person they say they are by looking at the way they text and speak to  people can you imagine
7141, Tadiwanashe Nzenze," Yoh. Thats huge, isn't it difficult though"

7143, Tadiwanashe Nzenze, Voice recognition?

7231, Rufaro, Good afternoon how is home have you received a reply from UZ yet
7232, Rufaro, Apo madii
7233, Venant, Warrup
7234, Rufaro, basa rikunakidza here zvamada mobile development
7235, Venant, 😂😂😂😂😂 haaa ndizvozvo wangu just trying waiziva😂😂😂
7236, Rufaro, I am working on a machine learning project where i develop a model that uses what is known as behavioural biometrics to authenticate a user.
7237, Rufaro, Like how different people have different handwritings or speech patterns i want it to make predictions on the user just by looking at the text that they enter at different times. So i may end up using deep learning.
7238, Venant, Ohhk ohhk thats interesting mans
7239, Rufaro, I was suggesting that the challenge that you might face when presenting some of the projects we are doing is the way we present them. If you can publish the application then publish it if  you cannot then a suggestion is to prepare the venue with internet connection so they can see code that is running.
7240, Venant, Yeah l will have to publish the application
7241, Rufaro, it is easier to present when you publish the application cause i think it also becomes hard to actually try and have you prove you know your code by erasing lines of code and having you reenter them.
7242, Venant, Yeah iyoyo ndonyaya yandisiri kuda😂😂😂
7243, Rufaro, Just don't forget to make sure that when you do publish your code add crash handlers and exceptions so it does not crash during presentation
7244, Venant, Ohhk sure mans danko
