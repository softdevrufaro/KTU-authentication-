19/03/2024, 08:45 - Bothaz: Okay
19/03/2024, 08:45 - Bothaz: If you can come up with a new concept/idea we will be grateful,  however coming up with new concepts require deep research. Research is all about improving what exists. They is no problem that has never been solved .All the  problems that you want to solve at your workplace has been solved. Now solutions are becoming smarter because of the technologies we now have including cloud, Big data, AI , IOT etc. We now want solutions that are ðŸ§  smarter. Yes improve what has been done. Some of your companies doesn't have basic solutions, etc  a website and they use a lot of paperwork .We don't want basic solutions,  that has been  done in other countries 20 years back.Come up with a system that can compete in  India,  southafrica,  America etc
19/03/2024, 08:45 - Bothaz: Give us a historical perspective 

Remember this problem did not start to exist today.It has existed for years now and all these years various researchers have attempted to solve the problem and they have solved the problem. The problem has been solved in different ways. 

Manual
Excel sheet 
Information management systems 
Intelligent info systems(Utilizing AI)

Problems has been always there but what changes is how the problems need to be solved 

Eg  communication
Problem: people need to communicate 

We have seen how researchers have solved the communication problem over the years. With the advent of new technologies. The way communication is being done is changing 

Early years- traditional methods of communicating etc using smoke , drums etc


Early 90's- emails
Early 200 - rise of telecommunications and mobile phones changed how people communicate (phone calls , sms)

Smartphones - these gave birth to social media platforms 

2020- social media platforms continue to be improved,  Facebook,  Twitter etc.AI is being infused in every aspect 

The way we communicate keeps on changing. The way we solve the communication problem keeps on charging.

The question you must ask yourself is how is your companies  problem being solved now. Be guided by the literature.Review the literature. Manual to digital is not what we want .You can always solve your company needs using the most current sophisticated techniques 

Come up with a product that can be exported  to Europe!!!
