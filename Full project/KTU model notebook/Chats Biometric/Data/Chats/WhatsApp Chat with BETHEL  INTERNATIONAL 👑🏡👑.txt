01/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 78 001 7053: I love the energy  in here

Let me do my job 

And  teach a little about  work
01/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 78 001 7053: One hot afternoon  I went for 


A practical lesson  

Woodwork to be precise  

And i did use a lot of energy 

Because  we were nearing the lunch hour
01/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 78 001 7053: I lost track of time 

And I arrived  ku hostel  

Plate yangu yesadza yadyiwa
01/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 78 001 7053: I felt a hot liquid  

Pour down  My eyes 

And zvarwaidza kupfura heartbreak
01/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 001 7053: My brother  found  me crying 

Like  someone  on a funeral

01/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 78 001 7053: Today i want to teach  

About  WORK 

By God's  grace
01/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 78 001 7053: People  substitute  

Work with prayer

But the Word Work 

Appears first before  Prayer

In our Bibles
01/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 78 001 7053: So the Bible  begins  with a lecture  

Of the Work  of God 

It describes  what it means 

When we say Mwari  vanobata basa
01/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 77 442 6999: But Why uchidaro soo😂
01/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 78 001 7053: If we journey  in Genesis  2 vs 2 we find  out  that  Genesis Chapter  is a summary  of God's  work



By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
01/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 78 001 7053: So the  first  thing  

We need  to establish  

Is the fact  that 

We are a product  of God's  work❤️
01/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 77 442 6999: And to make matters worse I was tt friend who ate tt plate😂😂😂😂

01/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 78 001 7053: We reflect  

The works of  God ❤️

01/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 78 001 7053: Secondly 

The  first  assignment  given to man 

Was not  to pray 

Or to love

Or to worship
01/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 78 001 7053: The first  thing  

God requested  from us 

Was to work
01/05/2024, 20:02 - +263 78 001 7053: If we travel  to the book  of Genesis  2 vs 15 

We see it clearly labeled  out 

Genesis  2 vs 15


The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to *work* it and take care of it.
01/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 78 001 7053: So there's no such  thing  as unemployment  to God 

God created  each of us to work
01/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 78 001 7053: And when  you work 

With alignment  to what God wants 

You get a reward
01/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 78 001 7053: Thirdly  

You are a product  of your parent's  work 😮
01/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 78 001 7053: Let me 

Surprise  you 👀
01/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 78 001 7053: You were not bought  

In a shop😂😂😂
01/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 78 001 7053: You 

Didn't  fall from heaven
01/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 78 001 7053: You 

Were not picked from the ground
01/05/2024, 20:06 - +263 78 001 7053: But 

Your parents  

Worked for you 😍❤️
01/05/2024, 20:07 - +263 78 001 7053: Through  

Courtship  

Through lobola  and marriage 

Through  the honeymoon  

Through  the pregnancy  stage 

Through  the labor  room
01/05/2024, 20:08 - +263 78 001 7053: Through  the 

School fees 

The meals 

The clothes  

Our parents 

Worked or are Working  for us
01/05/2024, 20:08 - +263 78 001 7053: If you love your parents 

Can you please react with this emoji 

❤️
01/05/2024, 20:11 - +263 78 001 7053: My High School 

Principal  would  insult all the notorious  students 

By saying  uri usiku hwakatambiswa😂😂
01/05/2024, 20:11 - +263 78 001 7053: Let me now get  

To the fulcrum  of My story
01/05/2024, 20:13 - +263 78 001 7053: Allow  me to introduce to you 

That there's  a difference  between  Working  for God 

And  having  God  work  for you
01/05/2024, 20:14 - +263 78 001 7053: We have  a class  of people 

Who work for God
01/05/2024, 20:14 - +263 78 001 7053: And a class of people 

Who God works for
01/05/2024, 20:15 - +263 78 001 7053: As Tinashe  Mugabe  preaches 

Pachishona tikuti 

Pane vanoshandira

Nevanoshandirwa na Mwari
01/05/2024, 20:17 - +263 78 001 7053: The most dangerous  thing  creation  can do 

Is to associate  itself 

With the work  that God didn't  allow  you to do <This message was edited>

01/05/2024, 20:19 - +263 78 001 7053: Satan was 

Employed by God to sing  

But in the book of Isaiah  

We find him 

Creating  another  job for himself  

That had no God in it
01/05/2024, 20:20 - +263 78 001 7053: Isaiah 14 vs 13 

Lays out a plan 

Of how Satan planned  to work  against  God
01/05/2024, 20:21 - +263 78 001 7053: Isaiah  14 vs 13



You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.
01/05/2024, 20:22 - +263 78 001 7053: It might  excite you to 

Know  that work doesn't  

Begin  with hands 

But  it begins  by planning  

In the head
01/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: So Satan in Isaiah  14 vs 13 

Had already  started working  against God
01/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: Some of us are working  

Against  God
01/05/2024, 20:23 - +263 78 001 7053: We say in our hearts

😮😮😮 I will invite  her in my room
01/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 78 001 7053: I will kiss her 

Then sleep  with her
01/05/2024, 20:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Some say 

I will  borrow  money  

I will not return  it 

I will buy beer with  it
01/05/2024, 20:25 - +263 78 001 7053: Some say I will buy data 

I will wait  for all to sleep  

Then i will watch pornography
01/05/2024, 20:26 - +263 78 001 7053: Satan had 7 I will plans 

😮😮

But it's scary  how some of us have 

More than 50 I will plans

Work for God 

So that they feel  better  than other 

People
01/05/2024, 20:31 - +263 78 258 5433: True
01/05/2024, 20:31 - +263 78 001 7053: People  who don't  work for  God 

From the heart 

But work for God to prove a point
01/05/2024, 20:32 - +263 78 001 7053: This

01/05/2024, 20:36 - +263 78 001 7053: When 

Abraham  obeyed 

God promised  to work  

For him
01/05/2024, 20:37 - +263 78 001 7053: It's captured  in the  book  of 

Genesis  12
01/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: Genesis  12 vs 2


"I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
01/05/2024, 20:38 - +263 78 001 7053: God will  make you a nation 

He will  bless  you 

He will  make  your name great  

He will make  you a blessing
01/05/2024, 20:40 - +263 78 001 7053: 12 vs 3


I will bless those who bless you,

 and whoever curses you I will curse;

 and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
01/05/2024, 20:41 - +263 78 001 7053: Ladies  and Gentlemen 

We can make  

God work for us

01/05/2024, 20:44 - +263 78 001 7053: Work 

Is not an old testament  philosophy
01/05/2024, 20:44 - +263 78 001 7053: We see it mentioned  by 

Paul
01/05/2024, 20:45 - +263 78 001 7053: Romans  8 vs 28


And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
01/05/2024, 20:47 - +263 78 001 7053: God works  for  those who love him 

And if you  love  me follow  my commandments
01/05/2024, 20:47 - +263 78 001 7053: And our commandment

Things may turn down a bit, 
But that may not be the end
Just hang on as best will come 
Just be there to see a change 
Don't feel radical or strange 
As you deserve the best in life 
Just be there!

*Pleasant day to you all*

02/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: Tonight we are going to talk about 

*The Light  of creativity*
02/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: First we have to understand what creativity is
02/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 71 944 6004: And the best definition of creativity 

Is *Creativity is who God is*
02/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: God gave each of us talents and creative minds
02/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: The first verse in the Bible says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and earth” 

Genesis 1:1
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: God is Creator

And He formed us in His image

so we’re creative too
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: Therefore the power to create is in us all
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: Each of us is not just a precious creation of God

But we are powerful creators with God
02/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: We have ability to use our light to create in every area of our lives
02/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: So out of light God created us and placed us in the Garden of Eden on earth which was also created out of light
02/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: So we are called to create something out of what already exists
02/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: Creating new ideas for his kingdom 
framing new attitudes and building new relationships for his glory
02/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: In Ephesians 2:10

we discover how we reflect God’s creativity

Paul reminds us we are God’s creation
02/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 71 944 6004: ”For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.“
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2‬:‭10
02/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 71 944 6004: We often think about creativity only in terms of arts etc
02/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 71 944 6004: But creativity is so much more than that

When we use our God given abilities to solve the problems we face in the world we are tapping into what it means to reflect the image of God
02/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 71 944 6004: And we will be producing light
02/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 71 944 6004: The light which comes from creativity
02/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 71 944 6004: So seeing God in a more creative light invites us to hear and move freely to the creativeness of the gospel
02/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 71 944 6004: We notice that the closer people got to Jesus

The more imaginative and daring they seemed to become
02/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 71 944 6004: Peter did not try walking on water 

Until he saw Jesus doing it
02/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 71 944 6004: Martha had not wondered about her brother coming back from the dead 


Until she heard what Jesus had in mind
02/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 78 866 0500: Amen
02/05/2024, 19:58 - +263 71 944 6004: There was no following Jesus without taking in and taking on the wild and wonderful possibilities he inspired day in and day out
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 71 944 6004: The good news is that being in Christ makes us not only new creations but also new creators
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 71 944 6004: Because he gives you the Light
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 77 442 6999: Amen
02/05/2024, 19:59 - +263 71 944 6004: Did you know you are called by God to be creative? 

If so how are you answering that call?
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: So tonight I have come to encourage someone to be creative
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: Because it produces light
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: This is a season of Light
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 77 402 5094: Following
02/05/2024, 20:00 - +263 71 944 6004: Don’t sit on your light
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 77 402 5094: *LIGHT*
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 71 944 6004: Make it shine
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 77 402 5094: These are nuggets
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 71 944 6004: Be creative
02/05/2024, 20:01 - +263 71 944 6004: Invest in the things of the kingdom for the production of your light and creativity
02/05/2024, 20:02 - +263 71 944 6004: The Bible says 

John 1:5 – “The light shines in the darkness. But the darkness has not overcome the light.”
02/05/2024, 20:02 - +263 71 944 6004: There’s something about this light
02/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 71 944 6004: God created the earth without the light of the sun because he didn’t need light he is the light
02/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 71 944 6004: And so are you
02/05/2024, 20:03 - +263 71 944 6004: Don’t wait for something extraordinary to come 

To become great
02/05/2024, 20:04 - +263 71 944 6004: Your light is already bright 

I pray the Lord shows us all how we can use the light that comes through us being creative for good works
02/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 71 944 6004: This is a different type of light 

The light of creation the light from the head
02/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 77 442 6999: Amen
02/05/2024, 20:05 - +263 71 944 6004: Good night 

You are loved 🙏🏽❤️
02/05/2024, 20:06 - +263 77 442 6999: Goodnight thank you for this wonderful words of God ❤️

02/05/2024, 22:43 - +263 78 669 9867: Powerful books 

l haven't read the second one though 🔥🫴🫴
02/05/2024, 22:45 - +263 78 814 7058: The first quality wise men should look out for in a
woman is the fear of the Lord. When I say fear of
the Lord, I don't just mean that she goes to church,
I don't just mean that she carries the bible, I don't
just mean that she prays, I mean she is a woman
that holds God in reverence and has a living,
breathing relationship with Him. Listen very
carefully, whether you are a man or woman, what
will sustain that marriage till the end is a personal
relationship with God, not with your spouse. I'm
not saying don't have a personal relationship with
your spouse, but your relationship with God must
supersede that.
Joseph had the chance to sleep with Potiphar's wife
but he said, "How can I do this great wickedness
and sin against God."(Gen 39:9). The issue was not
about Potiphar. Potiphar would not have known,
but Joseph had the fear of God. Listen, your spouse
will not do some certain things to you or against
you if they fear God.
My wife doesn't just submit to me all the time
because I'm saying what she likes, no. The bible
says you should submit because you are a wife.
(Ephesians 5:22) and that's what she's practicing.
The woman is not just submitting because she
believes or because she agrees with everything the
man is saying, no! She submits because she wants
to honor God and honor God's word!
Just the same way the Bible says the woman should
submit, the Bible also says as a man, you should love your wife! (Ephesians 5:25) That means you
put her first! That means that sometimes you don't
feel like doing certain things, but because you fear
God and you want to honor God, you do those
things. You need to understand that if the person
you want to marry is doing everything he or she is
doing just because of you, the day you annoy them
there will be consequences.

03/05/2024, 08:24 - +263 78 001 7053: It's a tragedy  

When you find  someone  who  is incomplete  as a partner <This message was edited>
03/05/2024, 08:25 - +263 78 001 7053: Someone  who lost  

Parts of him or herself  

Through  their  past
03/05/2024, 08:27 - +263 78 001 7053: Last week  we managed  to establish  

That when  people  have  sexual  relations  

A part  of them is taken away
03/05/2024, 08:28 - +263 78 814 7058: Yes
03/05/2024, 08:29 - +263 78 001 7053: Genesis  2 vs 24 was our anchor  verse 

And  we managed  to diagnose  that the more a person  sleeps with people  

The higher the chances  they lose  part of themselves
03/05/2024, 08:31 - +263 78 001 7053: That's why there's a proliferation  of divorce  cases these days 

Because  people  can't  compete  each other any more 

The sexual  milage  of people  has become a concern
03/05/2024, 08:33 - +263 78 001 7053: Although  this  revelation  was hard to digest  

We found  that through  the Holy  communion  

Through  the blood  of Jesus  our  sins are forgiven

And through  the bread or flesh  of Jesus  we are made complete
03/05/2024, 08:35 - +263 78 001 7053: As we are gathering  together  tomorrow  

We all get a chance  to be made whole  again 

We all are presented with an opportunity  to be made new again ❤️😊

03/05/2024, 13:24 - +263 71 142 4091: because in ecclesiastes chapter 7 it says the day you die is better than the day you were born
03/05/2024, 13:25 - +263 71 142 4091: its because the day you die becomes the trademark of your nextlife........

Just be there!

05/05/2024, 06:45 - +263 78 123 5470: When the time is right, God is going to move you from the back row to the front row and bless you in the presence of your enemies. He is going to lift you from grass to Grace and from breakthrough to breakthrough. A time is coming where you are going to forget about all the struggles you have been through, you are going to forget about all the sorrows and pains because God is going to bless you so much. Be inspired, be encouraged, be optimistic and believe God for a brighter future. May God go into your future and arrange everything in your favor as the Holy spirit continues to lead the way in Jesus’ Name.

_INSPIRED BY ISAIAH 60:22_

Muduku achava chiuru, akadukupa achava rudzi rune simba; ini Jehovha ndichakurumidza kuzviita nenguva yazvo. 

60:22	The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the LORD; in its time I will do this swiftly."

06/05/2024, 13:40 - +263 77 300 6134: And one of the ways we learnt was how his shadow comes first before his arrival
06/05/2024, 13:40 - +263 77 300 6134: Some of the darkness you go through is a preparation for the arrival of God in your life
06/05/2024, 13:42 - +263 77 300 6134: So you have to be able to see 


That this situation, it can only be God who is on the way ❤️
06/05/2024, 13:43 - +263 77 300 6134: When God arrives he shakes that which was already existing

06/05/2024, 13:44 - +263 77 300 6134: He comes and makes room for Himself

06/05/2024, 14:39 - +263 78 346 1988: Ini i say so  coz God didn't tell us if he started on Monday or Friday or any of those dates since they were man crafted ..so we cant pin point the exact date he started creation according to the days of the week . henceforth we can say u can choose your own date to set it as a Sabbath how ever a certain church made sartuday as their day and enforced the norm.to everyone which is not wrong so ur Sabbath can be Monday or Friday or Wednesday ..
06/05/2024, 14:40 - +263 78 346 1988: Its not that date that matter it's the amount of heart and spirit you put into the date to honour God

06/05/2024, 19:29 - +263 78 346 1988: My pastor is typing ..
06/05/2024, 19:29 - +263 71 944 6004: Today I will share a short teaching about Grace
06/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 71 944 6004: And I’m in the book of Genesis chapter 20
06/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 71 944 6004: The Story we have probably heard a couple of times
06/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 71 944 6004: The story of Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:31 - +263 71 944 6004: When he decieves Abimelech
06/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 71 944 6004: So today I learnt something in the morning about Grace and Saint Hennessy gave me the opportunity to teach tonight and Id like to share the word with you all ❤️
06/05/2024, 19:33 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Abraham introduced his wife, Sarah, by saying, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for Sarah and had her brought to him at his palace.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭2
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”But that night God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are a dead man, for that woman you have taken is already married!”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭3
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭4
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘Yes, he is my brother.’ I acted in complete innocence! My hands are clean.” In the dream God responded, “Yes, I know you are innocent. That’s why I kept you from sinning against me, and why I did not let you touch her.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭5‬-‭6
06/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Now return the woman to her husband, and he will pray for you, for he is a prophet. Then you will live. But if you don’t return her to him, you can be sure that you and all your people will die.”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭7
06/05/2024, 19:35 - +263 71 944 6004: So my message is coming from these scriptures
06/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 71 944 6004: Abimelech said to God I did this in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands
06/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 71 944 6004: And he said this because he hadn’t slept with Sarah
06/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 71 944 6004: And the Lord responded to him saying 

He knows his heart is pure
06/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 71 944 6004: But when it comes to the action of not doing wrong
06/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 71 944 6004: He kept him from sinning
06/05/2024, 19:39 - +263 71 944 6004: He was saying yes you were decieved 

You didn’t know that Sarah was a wife to Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:39 - +263 71 944 6004: But when it comes to you not sleeping with her
06/05/2024, 19:40 - +263 71 944 6004: He made him not sleep with her
06/05/2024, 19:40 - +263 71 944 6004: ”Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.“
‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5‬:‭23
06/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 71 944 6004: God is able to keep you blameless
06/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 71 944 6004: When it comes to being righteous
06/05/2024, 19:41 - +263 71 944 6004: It is something that you are made

Not something that you do
06/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 71 944 6004: God showed this through Abraham and Abimelech
06/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 71 944 6004: The Lord doesn’t want us to be moving as if we are being righteous in our own ways
06/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 71 944 6004: He makes us righteous
06/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 71 944 6004: The Lord was angry at Abimelech because he said


”But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭20‬:‭4
06/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 71 944 6004: He was now thinking he is an innocent nation

He had taken his innocence to national level 😂
06/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 71 944 6004: Yet the Lord made him innocent for the sake of Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 71 944 6004: That kind of mindset 

The Lord revealed to me that it is not what keeps our relationship with him
06/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 71 944 6004: When we look at ourselves higher than what God has made us 

Putting ourselves in positions where we take the Lord’s glory
06/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 71 944 6004: We might say 

I don’t sleep around with people 

I don’t go to clubs

I don’t fornicate but the Lord is saying
06/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 71 944 6004: I am the one keeping you from doing those sins
06/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 71 944 6004: So we must stay humble enough to acknowledge that the Lord is making us righteous not our own works or ability
06/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 71 944 6004: God is saying don’t boast to me
06/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: And Abraham also had committed a sin
06/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 71 944 6004: He lied
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: But even at that time God was with him protecting him
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: He did things out of fear
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: Yet in that moment the Lord made him a prophet
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: Before that we had no record of Abraham being a prophet
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: So even when you are wrong
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: The Lord is gracious
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: Even when you are not in the right position
06/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 71 944 6004: I’m not encouraging you to do wrong 😂
06/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: But There is no part of Christian true living that is earned
06/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: It is given to us by the Holy Spirit
06/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 71 944 6004: We are made righteous because God makes us righteous
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: We are made Holy because God calls us Holy
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: Abraham became a prophet because God named him a prophet
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: After that we see him operating as a Prophet
06/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 71 944 6004: Showing that God is the one who makes us
06/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: Our Father has named each and every one of us and called us to be something
06/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: And by his grace we shall become what he has said like Abraham
06/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 71 944 6004: Good night

06/05/2024, 21:34 - +263 78 692 6053: Those were Jesus' words that he told to the disciples concerning the last days 
What was going to happen in the last days 

Firstly he told them that everything that you see in this world will be destroyed and there's nothing, not anything, not even a stone will be left 

He told them that many people will come saying that they are the Messiah but don't believe them 
False prophets will rise and deceive people but don't listen to them 

He went on Saying that see I've told you ahead of time, but here it applies to us the present believers that we have to know all those things concerning the end times so that we may know what will happen 
So that we may be ready for his second coming before the Greatest tribulation 

When he comes, he will take others through rapture 
But those who are left behind will face this great tribulation 
Most people will lose faith but those who will endure to the end will be saved at the end 
He mentioned that the days of the tribulation were shortened because of the love of God 

On verse 35, he said that, this generation will not pass until these things happen
If you relate to what he had  said contextually, you'll realize that he had said that like in the days of Noah, when what was happening in the days of Noah starts happening now, just know that , it is that generation that will not pass ...


He boldly  told them that, his words will never pass away like the heavens and the earth 

Thank you
06/05/2024, 22:44 - +263 78 346 1988: We need to understand what was happening in the days of noah .there was eating marrying and drinking .. 
Peolpe are doing all that but there is a kind of eating marrying drinking that provoked God those days. Which is also happening now .. behold my time is near he says

Fit in the equation
06/05/2024, 23:25 - +263 78 001 7053: A day  when  people  

No longer  want to receive  your love
06/05/2024, 23:30 - +263 78 001 7053: From

Peace  

To piercing
06/05/2024, 23:34 - +263 78 038 1294: 🤣🌚iiih nhai muporofita 🤣💔
06/05/2024, 23:36 - +263 78 001 7053: On such  a day 

You will allow  your seed  to speak for you
06/05/2024, 23:41 - +263 78 001 7053: Jesus  arrived  at a stage  where  prayer  was  difficult 

And he felt  empty
06/05/2024, 23:42 - +263 78 001 7053: But all he could  give  was his body  as a seed
07/05/2024, 01:43 - +263 71 276 7383: Sorry general 🥹

07/05/2024, 18:59 - +263 71 944 6004: Tonight I’m going to teach about 

*THE GRACE OF GOD*🙏🏽
07/05/2024, 18:59 - +263 71 944 6004: This is our anchor scripture 

”he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;“
‭‭Romans‬ ‭4‬:‭20
07/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 78 258 5433: Ready🗒️
07/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 71 944 6004: The scripture is talking about Abraham
07/05/2024, 19:00 - +263 78 669 9867: Powerful
07/05/2024, 19:01 - +263 71 944 6004: It says Abraham staggered not at the promise
07/05/2024, 19:01 - +263 71 944 6004: To *stagger* is to move unsteadily as if about to fall
07/05/2024, 19:02 - +263 71 944 6004: The scripture says Abraham did not move unsteadily Abraham did not fall  at the promise
07/05/2024, 19:02 - +263 78 258 5433: Yessssss🔥📌
07/05/2024, 19:02 - +263 71 944 6004: You might be like me when I first read the scripture I was like how
07/05/2024, 19:03 - +263 71 944 6004: Because there’s an entire tribe from Ishmael from his fall he chose Hagar to give him a child since Sarah was barren
07/05/2024, 19:04 - +263 71 944 6004: And Abraham out of fear lied that Sarah was his sister to Kung Abimelech
07/05/2024, 19:04 - +263 71 944 6004: He questioned God he made his own solutions
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 71 944 6004: But when the Bible recorded about him

You would think  Abraham never made a mistake
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 71 944 6004: The Bible said he staggered not

It says he did not make any mistakes
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 78 258 5433: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
07/05/2024, 19:05 - +263 71 944 6004: Yet there’s people like Esau who made 1 mistake but the Bible calls him an infidel
07/05/2024, 19:06 - +263 71 944 6004: In the New Testament
07/05/2024, 19:06 - +263 78 258 5433: 🙆🏽‍♀️🔥
07/05/2024, 19:06 - +263 71 944 6004: An infidel is "unfaithful" a person who is accused of disbelief in their beliefs
07/05/2024, 19:07 - +263 71 944 6004: But Abraham hanzi he staggered not
07/05/2024, 19:07 - +263 71 944 6004: I was like Lord 

What was Hagar ? She’s a stagger 👀😂
07/05/2024, 19:07 - +263 71 944 6004: But because when God defines 

He doesn’t define you by what you’ve done
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 78 669 9867: Teach 🔥
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 71 944 6004: He defines you by what he has made you to be
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 71 944 6004: Holiness is not something you achieve
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 71 944 6004: Holiness is what you are made
07/05/2024, 19:08 - +263 78 342 0350: Yes🙏
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: ”And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy and complete for all time!“
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭10‬:‭14
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: He made us perfectly holy
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: It’s what he calls us
07/05/2024, 19:09 - +263 71 944 6004: Abraham though he staggered in the Old Testament
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: But because he trusted God enough to make the line of Jesus
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: He was going to be defined after Jesus
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 348 5628: <Media omitted>
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: No matter what you’ve done in the past
07/05/2024, 19:10 - +263 71 944 6004: No matter what you’re struggling with
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 78 258 5433: Ouuuuuuuuu🥵✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 71 944 6004: When God is going to talk about you
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 71 944 6004: It will be

Behold my holy child
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 78 258 5433: My Godddddd🥵🥵🥵
07/05/2024, 19:11 - +263 71 944 6004: And youll even be shocked yourself that what is Jesus saying does he know me
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: But because you believed in him
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: Though you never saw the actual cross he died on
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: Jesus celebrates your
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: I want someone to pray that the Lord helps them
07/05/2024, 19:12 - +263 71 944 6004: To see themselves the way he sees them
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: Because if you see yourself from God’s perspective
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: Religion will irritate you
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: Religion calls you by your weaknesses
07/05/2024, 19:13 - +263 71 944 6004: And it identifies you by your weaknesses
07/05/2024, 19:14 - +263 71 348 5628: <Media omitted>
07/05/2024, 19:14 - +263 71 944 6004: But Jesus calls you as

07/05/2024, 19:15 - +263 71 944 6004: He was perfect to God

08/05/2024, 07:14 - +263 78 254 9256: Wat do you mean.... Like his background here
08/05/2024, 07:15 - +263 71 553 4360: yes
08/05/2024, 07:20 - +263 78 254 9256: Isiah 1: 1

08/05/2024, 08:20 - +263 78 001 7053: The strongest team in the world  is not Man City or Real Madrid 😮
08/05/2024, 08:21 - +263 78 001 7053: But the strongest  team in the world is 

The 

Praise and  Worship  team
08/05/2024, 08:22 - +263 78 001 7053: This team does not only  entertain  us 


But it connects  us deeper  to God
08/05/2024, 08:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Though  this team is powerful  

Sometimes  it kills the growth  of an average  believer  

To think  that praise  is achieved  through  singing  fast songs 

And worship  is attainable  when we sing  slow sweet  songs
08/05/2024, 08:25 - +263 78 001 7053: There are levels  in 

Everything  

And there's  rank in  every  place  you go 

Even Kuma humbwe 😂
08/05/2024, 08:26 - +263 78 001 7053: In trying  to find  meaning  in the Bible  there's  what is called  the Law of first mention 

Meaning  you consult  when the word was first used in the Bible
08/05/2024, 08:28 - +263 78 001 7053: The Word  worship  was first employed in Genesis  22 vs 25
08/05/2024, 08:30 - +263 78 001 7053: The  Word was used when Abraham  was selfless  to go and sacrifice  his own Son Issac  as a sign of Obedience  to God
08/05/2024, 08:31 - +263 78 001 7053: Thus  being  said  we can establish  that worship is beyond  singing  

Worship  beyond  sweet  words 

But the deepest  part of worship  is in sacrifice
08/05/2024, 08:31 - +263 78 001 7053: The Bible  then makes  it clear  to us 

That those  who worship  God must worship  in spirit  and Truth
08/05/2024, 08:32 - +263 78 001 7053: What God  desires  most 

Is Worship
08/05/2024, 08:33 - +263 78 001 7053: And it's sad that most of us 

Have wrongly  defined  worship  for decades
08/05/2024, 08:34 - +263 78 001 7053: This week 

God is being  gracious  enough  to afford  us an opportunity  

To worship  him 

Through  our substance ❤️🔥❤️
08/05/2024, 08:35 - +263 78 001 7053: Meaning  we are Giving  unto God 

Sacrificing  what we have  for the Kingdom  of God to be shared across  the world
08/05/2024, 08:36 - +263 78 001 7053: The List above  is comprising  of people  

Who understand the deep revelation  of what True  Worship is

'Have you tried my servant  prince'
08/05/2024, 19:17 - +263 78 001 7053: So when  Peter  healed  

A crippled  man 

He went into a court  session
08/05/2024, 19:21 - +263 78 001 7053: And the major  reason  of the court  session  was

The source  of Power  which Peter  used to heal
08/05/2024, 19:23 - +263 78 001 7053: Acts 4 vs 7


They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: "By what power or what name did you do this?"
08/05/2024, 19:24 - +263 78 001 7053: Peter then responded  in 4 vs 10



then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
08/05/2024, 19:24 - +263 78 258 5433: Following 📌
08/05/2024, 19:25 - +263 78 001 7053: The Judges were not  pleased  with answer
08/05/2024, 19:26 - +263 78 001 7053: But the most unfortunate  part for them 

There was no law written  down which  prohibited  people  from using  the power  of Jesus
08/05/2024, 19:27 - +263 78 001 7053: Hence these men could  not be put in prison

Question iri pakuti ndinoisa 0 here oro 1
08/05/2024, 20:55 - +263 77 891 7712: *Problem:* 01001001 + 00101111

*Step 1:* Align the two binary numbers:

```
  01001001
+ 00101111
```

*Step 2:* Add each column from right to left:

```
  01001001
+ 00101111
------
  01110100
```

*Answer:* 01110100

Here's the calculation in each column:

- Rightmost column (2^0): 1 + 1 = 10 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^1): 0 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 10 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^2): 0 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 10 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^3): 1 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 11 (carry 1)
- Next column (2^4): 0 + 0 + 1 (carried) = 1
- Next column (2^5): 1 + 0 = 1
- Next column (2^6): 0 + 0 = 0
- Leftmost column (2^7): 0 + 0 = 0

08/05/2024, 23:28 - +263 78 814 7058: Usually when I talk about relationships I like to start
by saying this: it is not about getting married, it is
about being happily married. If it were about just
getting married to anybody, then you could as well go
to a native doctor or somebody to do something for
you just to get married. In fact, you could even buy a
husband or a wife. However, I believe marriage is
beyond getting married but being happily married.
And trust me, I have been counseling couples for a
while so I can tell you it is better to be happy and
single than to be married and sad. That is why my
emphasis is on how to help you build the marriage of
your dreams; not just to marry anybody or marry at all
cost but to be happily married.
Sometimes when you are in a romantic relationship or
you meet somebody you like, the rate at which the
relationship progresses is so fast that you don't have
time to ask the important questions. It's like driving a
brand new car especially if you've been driving an
old one before. You will discover that when you are driving the old car, there is a level you will hit on the
speedometer that the car begins to jerk. That's a sign
that you are going beyond your limit but when it is a
brand new car that is in good condition, you might be
at a very high speed and not even know it. Driving fast
and not knowing it is dangerous. That's how some
people's relationships are! So these questions are like
your speedometer; to help you know when you are
over speeding or doing things wrongly.
The mistake a lot of people make especially women is
that they think marriage is it, that it is the last bus-stop.
No! Marriage is not an end in itself; it's just a means to
an end: fulfillment! Marriage is a long trip and if you
are not fulfilled, you will be discontented. There is no
middle ground. It's either one or the other. That is
why you must prepare well and ask the right
questions before you hand over your life to that man.
You have to be sure that the man you are giving the
rest of your life to is worth it.
Another thing I noticed is, when the people around
you are not experienced or knowledgeable, they ask
the wrong questions. They ask questions like: Do you
love him? Does he love you? And those things are very vague! Many people don't even know what love
is! So do you love him means do you have butterflies
in your stomach? And she does! You can't hand over
your destiny to some man just because you have
butterflies in your stomach! You must ask the right
questions!
When I say ask questions, I don't mean you should sit
him down and bring out your paper and pen and say
question time. No! That's not what I'm saying. Some of
these questions are things you might need to ask
yourself, some are things you might ask indirectly and
some are things you might need to observe or watch
as the relationship or friendship progresses. Don't
make it so obvious otherwise he will give you a
"good" answer. He will tell you exactly what he knows
you want to hear.

09/05/2024, 23:04 - +263 78 692 6053: ‭John 15:18-19 NIV‬
[18]  “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. [19] If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 


‭James 4:4 NIV‬
[4] You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. 

 We don't belong to the World.

10/05/2024, 09:13 - +263 78 001 7053: Beautiful Morning ❤️

Without  a shadow  of doubt I can confirm  that you people  truly  love  God ❤️

Your sacrifices  for the Kingdom  just reflect that you deserve  a Kingdom  life ❤️

May the altars you are building  through  giving  never run  dry 

May your seed dig deep a well that will feed you and your generations to come 


Receive  favor from God 

Receive  favor from People 

May your names be on the lips of the rich 

May your names be on the prayer points  of prophets 

Above all May your names remain  in the book  of life❤️
10/05/2024, 09:16 - +263 78 001 7053: I wish  I could  join  words neatly  

I wish I could  sound  more spiritual 

But I would  love  to encourage others  to not miss out on this opportunity  to bless  the Lord 

Be it through  a dollar  or more❤️
10/05/2024, 09:18 - +263 78 001 7053: Luke 10 vs 2 


He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
10/05/2024, 09:21 - +263 78 001 7053: This  verse  is not only  limited  to winning  souls
10/05/2024, 09:21 - +263 78 001 7053: But it also patterns  to working  for God through  various  means
10/05/2024, 09:22 - +263 78 001 7053: And one of the  means of work is through  giving  ❤️
10/05/2024, 09:24 - +263 78 001 7053: When you participate  

In God's  project  

You automatically  fit yourself  in God's  plan

But God seems to be silent
10/05/2024, 19:26 - +263 78 721 0133: Yes, marinate and fry us 😊❤️
10/05/2024, 19:26 - +263 77 454 8584: Then again we look at God's words in the bible and he will be saying 
I will never leave you nor forsake 
He will be saying my love for you surpasses all understanding 
But we really don't see it <This message was edited>
10/05/2024, 19:27 - +263 77 454 8584: We look at our lives and we thing haa maybe God doesn't really love me

10/05/2024, 19:28 - +263 77 454 8584: Romans 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

10/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 77 454 8584: Are things really working together for good in your life 🤔
10/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 77 454 8584: ‭Romans 8:28 NIV‬
[28] And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. 

https://bible.com/bible/111/rom.8.28.NIV
10/05/2024, 19:30 - +263 77 454 8584: Most people love this verse 
We have heard it so many times
10/05/2024, 19:31 - +263 78 026 5054: Not all
But grateful for the little i have😊
10/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 77 454 8584: But we then ask ourselves why things are not working together for good in our lives
10/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 77 454 8584: We ask ourselves why we suffer despite having a purpose or a prophesy that has been said over our lives
10/05/2024, 19:32 - +263 78 849 1118: 😭😭😭no
10/05/2024, 19:33 - +263 77 454 8584: You look at everything you do and you say you love the Lord 
So then why isn't everything working together for good
10/05/2024, 19:34 - +263 77 454 8584: This is because  in most times when we read scripture 
We take the parts we like 
But then we ignore the requirements that comes with certain scriptures
10/05/2024, 19:36 - +263 78 488 1340: Very true
10/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 77 454 8584: Romans 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

10/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 77 454 8584: What is to love God
10/05/2024, 19:37 - +263 77 454 8584: The condition for this verse is that 
All things work for good 
*for those who love  God*
10/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 77 454 8584: Saying I love you Lord is not enough
10/05/2024, 19:38 - +263 77 454 8584: Praying is not enough
10/05/2024, 19:39 - +263 78 849 1118: Yes‼️‼️
10/05/2024, 19:40 - +263 77 454 8584: Loving God is hating the things of the flesh
10/05/2024, 19:40 - +263 77 454 8584: Loving God is hating evil
10/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 77 891 7712: <Media omitted>
10/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 77 461 9483: Yes🔥🔥🔥
10/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 77 454 8584: ‭Romans 8:7-8 NIV‬
[7] The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. [8] Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.

https://bible.com/bible/111/rom.8.7-8.NIV
10/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 77 454 8584: For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit  to God's law indeed it cannot 
Those who are in flesh cannot please  God
10/05/2024, 19:42 - +263 77 454 8584: To love God is to please him 
And we please God by denying the things of the flesh and submitting to the things of the spirits
10/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 77 454 8584: Because the spirit of God brings peace and joy
10/05/2024, 19:43 - +263 77 454 8584: The spirit of God brings love that cannot be explained
10/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 78 849 1118: The word of the season🔥🔥🔥🔥
10/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 77 454 8584: So you cannot claim to love God and still love the things of the flesh
10/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 77 454 8584: All things will work together for good for the ones who love the Lord
10/05/2024, 19:44 - +263 77 454 8584: The condition is to love the Lord
10/05/2024, 19:45 - +263 77 454 8584: Anyone who does not have the spirit of Christ does not belong to him
10/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 77 461 9483: Eish😬
10/05/2024, 19:46 - +263 77 461 9483: Oh yes🔥
10/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 77 454 8584: Romans 8 Verse 14 for all who are led by the spirit are the children of God
10/05/2024, 19:47 - +263 77 454 8584: Loving God is allowing the spirit to lead you
10/05/2024, 19:48 - +263 77 454 8584: When you are lead by the spirit  
Then that's when you become a child of God
10/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 77 454 8584: You cannot claim to be a child of God and sin all the time
10/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 78 849 1118: 🫵🏾
10/05/2024, 19:49 - +263 77 454 8584: God is looking for children who are fully committed to the things of the spirit
10/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 77 454 8584: If you are disconnected from the spirit then some verses will not work for you
10/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 77 454 8584: There are so many verse in the bible in which God is promising protection, wisdom, prosperity, security
10/05/2024, 19:50 - +263 77 454 8584: The list is endless
10/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 77 454 8584: We read some of these verses and we think the Lord has forsaken us
10/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 77 454 8584: It's because we do not look at the conditions 
We do not look at the requirements to be called a child of God
10/05/2024, 19:51 - +263 77 454 8584: If you Love the Lord you will follow his words
10/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 77 454 8584: If you love his you will worship him
10/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 77 454 8584: If you love him you will sacrifice for him
10/05/2024, 19:52 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see things work together for good in your life
10/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see that truly truly is goodness and mercy follows you all the day of your life
10/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see that if he is for us then who can be against us
10/05/2024, 19:53 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to see a thousand on your right ten thousand on your left and non coming near you
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: Then you will start to have joy and peace that does not make sence
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: You will start to have joy in chaos
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: Peace in chaos
10/05/2024, 19:54 - +263 77 454 8584: All things really work together for good for the one who loves the Lord
10/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 77 454 8584: Look at the areas of your life where you want God to intervene, and it looks like he is not doing anything
10/05/2024, 19:55 - +263 77 454 8584: Then  look at your lifestyle 
Are you denying the things of the flesh 
Are you resisting the devil
10/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 77 454 8584: Start to follow the things of the spirit and see what the Lord does for his children
10/05/2024, 19:56 - +263 77 454 8584: Show your love for the Lord
10/05/2024, 19:57 - +263 77 454 8584: If you love the Lord you will follow his words and submit your spirit  
Then all things will start to make sense and work together for good in your life

13/05/2024, 20:14 - +263 78 001 7053: Afraid  to see her in a desperate  state  I didn't  go home 

I stayed at school  and engaged  in prayers with my friends

14/05/2024, 08:04 - +263 78 001 7053: Ecclesiastes 11 vs 5


As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.
14/05/2024, 08:05 - +263 78 001 7053: 11 vs 6 


Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.

14/05/2024, 08:15 - +263 78 001 7053: Ecclesiastes 11 vs 8


However many years a man may live, let him enjoy them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.
14/05/2024, 08:15 - +263 78 001 7053: 11 vs 9 


Be happy, young man, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
14/05/2024, 08:16 - +263 78 001 7053: 11 vs 10


So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.

14/05/2024, 10:35 - +263 78 488 1340: I think it depends with what was your relationship like. Remember you don't just get into a relationship with someone for the fun of things it's actually with marriage as an end result so you end up investing yourself emotionally. So, when someone end up leaving it drains you and that's whats painful, that's where the heartbreak part comes in. I don't know if that is making sense <This message was edited>
14/05/2024, 10:38 - +263 78 814 7058: Yes, it is making sense.
